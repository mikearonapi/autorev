# VERIFICATION GATE (Priority: HIGHEST)

> **STOP. Before marking ANY todo complete, you MUST complete this gate.**

## Before Setting `status: "completed"` on ANY Todo:

```
□ I have DEFINED success criteria (not just "do X")
□ I have RUN a verification query/check (not assumed)
□ I can CITE the evidence (line numbers, row counts, query results)
□ If I said "all X", I have LISTED every X explicitly
```

**If ANY box is unchecked → DO NOT mark complete.**

## Verification Evidence Format

When marking a todo complete, include in your response:

```
VERIFIED: [todo description]
Evidence:
- [Specific proof: query result, line number, file check]
```

## Examples

**❌ WRONG:**
> Marking task complete.

**✅ RIGHT:**
> VERIFIED: Add pipelineLogger to expandFitments.mjs
> Evidence:
> - Import: line 37 `import { PipelineRun } from '../lib/pipelineLogger.js'`
> - Usage: 7 occurrences of `pipelineRun` in file
> - Grep output confirms both import and usage present

**This gate is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Speed is not an excuse to skip verification.**
