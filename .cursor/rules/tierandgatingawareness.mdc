AutoRev uses tier-based feature gating.

Tiers:
- free → collector → tuner → admin

Rules:
- Always respect tier access defined in tierAccess and documentation
- Do NOT bypass gates unless IS_BETA is explicitly referenced
- UI components must use PremiumGate for gated features
- APIs must enforce auth and tier checks where applicable

If unsure whether a feature is gated, STOP and ask.
