# Feature Workflow

## Phase 1: UNDERSTAND
1. Restate what's being built
2. Identify affected areas
3. Check tier access requirements

## Phase 2: RESEARCH
1. **Read SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md** — Cardinal rules, anti-patterns
2. **Search existing code** — Don't duplicate
3. List what to reuse vs create

```
📖 SOURCE_OF_TRUTH: [Rules that apply]
🔍 EXISTING CODE: [What to reuse]
🆕 NEW CODE NEEDED: [What to create]
```

## Phase 3: PLAN
1. Component/file structure
2. Data flow
3. State ownership
4. Get approval before implementing

## Phase 4: BUILD
Invoke specialists as needed:
- UI work → `@frontend-agent`, `@ui-quality-agent`
- Data work → `@database-agent`
- API work → `@security-agent`

## Phase 5: VERIFY
```
✅ VERIFICATION:
- [ ] Works as specified
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Loading/error states
- [ ] SOURCE_OF_TRUTH patterns followed
- [ ] Evidence: [show output]
```
