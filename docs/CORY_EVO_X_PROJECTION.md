- **Fuel:** E85, full fuel system supporting mods
- **Supporting:** Full bolt-ons, intercooler, etc.

## Model Comparison

| Model | Your Projected WHP | How It Calculates |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Legacy Model** | 680 HP | Hardcoded values: Stage 3 tune (200 HP) + turbo upgrade (120 HP) + E85 (80 HP) × 1.3 turbo multiplier, with category caps |
| **Physics Model** | 600-650 WHP | Turbo flow capacity, boost pressure ratios, fuel effects, calibrated against real dyno data |
| **Our Best Estimate** | **640-670 WHP** | Physics model + your Stage 3 cams advantage over typical forum builds |

## How We Refined the Projection

### Step 1: Forum Data Collection
We scraped and verified real dyno results from EvolutionM and Evo X forums:

| Build | WHP | Fuel | Turbo | Source |
|-------|-----|------|-------|--------|
| David's Evo X | 607 | E85 | FP Black (62mm) | EvolutionM, verified |
| Same car, pump gas | 530 | 93 | FP Black | EvolutionM |
| GTX3576R build | 591 | E85 | GTX3576R | EvolutionM, tubular manifold |
| GTX3576R ceiling | ~650 | E85 | GTX3576R | Forum consensus |
| 2.4L Stroker | 503 | 93 | GTX3576R | EvolutionM, pump gas only |

### Step 2: Turbo Comparison
Your GTX3576R Gen 2 vs FP Black (most common Evo X big turbo):

| Spec | FP Black | GTX3576R Gen 2 |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Inducer | 62mm | 58mm |
| Flow Range | 450-650 HP | 500-850 HP |
| Efficiency | ~72% | ~78% |
| Best E85 Result | 607 WHP | 591 WHP (650 theoretical) |

The GTX3576R has better compressor efficiency despite smaller inducer, but forum results show it tops out around **650 WHP on E85**.

### Step 3: Your Build Advantages
Most forum GTX3576R builds run **stock cams**. Your Stage 3 cams add:
- +12% volumetric efficiency
- Better airflow at high RPM
- Shifts powerband up (works well with big turbo)

This gives you an edge over typical forum results.

### Step 4: Physics Calculation
```
Base: 291 HP
× Boost PR (33 PSI target): 1.34
× Stage 3 Cams VE: 1.12  
× E85 Fuel Bonus: 1.15
× Turbo Efficiency: 0.78
─────────────────────────────
= 620-670 WHP range
```

```

### Why This Range?
- **Floor (640 WHP):** Forum consensus GTX3576R ceiling (650) minus small margin
- **Ceiling (670 WHP):** Your Stage 3 cams should push slightly above typical results
- **Hard limit:** GTX3576R compressor maxes around 65 lb/min airflow, limiting peak HP regardless of other mods

### What Would Push You Higher?
To break 700+ WHP, you'd need:
- Larger turbo (GTX3582R or GTX3584RS)
- Or stroker kit (2.2L or 2.4L)

## Model Accuracy Check

| Source | Prediction | vs Your Build |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Legacy (AutoRev current) | 680 HP | Slightly optimistic (+2-6%) |
| Physics (calibrated) | 640-670 WHP | **Best estimate** ✓ |
| Forum average (GTX3576R + E85) | ~620 WHP | You should beat this (cams) |
| Forum ceiling (GTX3576R) | 650 WHP | You may exceed slightly |

## To Verify

When you dyno the car, share the numbers and we'll:
1. Add your result as **Tier 1 verified data**
2. Use it to calibrate the physics model for GTX3576R + Stage 3 cam builds
3. Improve predictions for other Evo X owners with similar setups

Your dyno would be the **first verified GTX3576R + Stage 3 cams** result in our database!
