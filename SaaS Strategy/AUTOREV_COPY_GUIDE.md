## Brand Voice & Tone

### Who AutoRev Sounds Like

**Imagine**: A friend who's a master mechanic AND knows the data. They're not trying to sell you anything — they genuinely want your build to succeed. They're confident but not cocky, knowledgeable but not condescending.

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | What It Means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Expert** | We know our stuff | "Headers add 15-25 HP on S54 engines" (specific, factual) |
| **Enthusiast** | We're one of you | "We've been down the forum rabbit hole too" |
| **Direct** | No fluff, no jargon | "This part fits. We checked." |
| **Confident** | We stand behind our data | "Here's what you'll get" (not "might get") |
| **Supportive** | We want you to succeed | "Let's figure out your next move" |

### Tone Shifts by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Homepage** | Confident, aspirational | "Build with confidence" |
| **Onboarding** | Welcoming, guiding | "Let's set up your garage" |
| **In-app** | Clear, helpful | "Your M3 is 73% complete" |
| **Achievement** | Celebratory, energizing | "7-day streak! You're on fire." |
| **Error** | Calm, solution-focused | "That didn't work. Try this instead." |
| **Upgrade prompt** | Value-focused, not pushy | "Want unlimited? Go Tuner." |

### The AutoRev Voice Test

Before publishing copy, ask:
1. Would a knowledgeable friend say this?
2. Is it specific, not vague?
3. Does it focus on the user's outcome?
4. Is it free of jargon and marketing fluff?

## Copy Don'ts

### Never Say These

| Don't | Why | Say Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| "Welcome to AutoRev!" | Generic | "Your garage is ready." |
| "Our platform offers..." | Company-focused | "You get..." |
| "Best-in-class" | Empty claim | (just describe what it does) |
| "Seamless experience" | Meaningless | "Easy to use" or nothing |
| "Users" | Impersonal | "Enthusiasts" or "You" |
| "Content" | Vague | "Builds" or "Guides" |
| "Click here" | Dated, accessibility issue | "[Descriptive CTA]" |
| "Please" (in CTAs) | Weakens action | Just state the action |
| "Sorry for the inconvenience" | Corporate | "That's frustrating. Here's how to fix it." |

### Avoid These Patterns

**Passive voice**:
- ❌ "Your car has been added"
- ✓ "Car added"

**Future tense when present works**:
- ❌ "You will receive an email"
- ✓ "Check your email"

**Hedging language**:
- ❌ "This might help improve..."
- ✓ "This improves..."

**Unnecessary words**:
- ❌ "In order to add a car..."
- ✓ "To add a car..."

**Jargon**:
- ❌ "Leverage our AI capabilities"
- ✓ "Ask AL"

## Checklist Before Publishing

Before any copy goes live, verify:

- [ ] **User-focused**: Does it say "you/your" more than "we/our"?
- [ ] **Outcome-first**: Does it lead with benefit, not feature?
- [ ] **Specific**: Does it use concrete language, not vague claims?
- [ ] **Active**: Is it active voice, not passive?
- [ ] **Clear**: Would a new user understand it immediately?
- [ ] **On-brand**: Does it sound like a knowledgeable friend?
- [ ] **Actionable**: Is it clear what the user should do next?

---

## Final Word

AutoRev's copy should make users feel like they have an expert friend who:
- Knows exactly what they need
- Speaks plainly, not in marketing-speak
- Genuinely wants their build to succeed
- Never bullshits them

Every word should either **build trust** or **drive action**. If it doesn't do one of those, cut it.
