right so you've probably heard of product hunt if you haven't they're one of the most successful listing sites on the internet and in today's video I want to break down their SEO strategy and show you exactly how a quote-unquote simple business model that is a listing website had such a great success in acquiring 100 million backlinks and leveraging ugc so user generated content for acquiring organic Graphics so essentially relying on their own users to drive traffic to their platform so it's super interesting so let's break it down for this I'm going to be using a couple of tools this one and of course ahrefs so let's get started with it so first things first today's product hunt essentially it is a site where people mostly Indie hackers and people building their own small products mostly software can list their products here as you can see you can upload them you can see what they are little descriptions of images and then there's the whole Community aspect of it which in my opinion is one of the most important factors of a listing website is not just the listings but the community around it and a bit of attention here in the future because of the commoditization of developers and all that I really think that the businesses that will Thrive are the ones that are heavily based around communities around people essentially so moving on that's part of towns pretty straightforward quite a simple product of course when I say simple it doesn't mean that anyone can create a business like this it's very very hard but the whole concept of how it works is somewhat simple now simple doesn't mean easy of course okay so let's break it down how do they acquire a hundred million backlinks that's a crazy amount of backlinks and you can see here from ahrefs that the number of backlinks that they have and of course they've been around for a while is close to a hundred million and if you don't do SEO or if you're not really into the Internet space 100 million backlinks is a whole lot so let's break it down it's quite simple and an interesting strategy so for example when you go to any of these products when you click any of these products and I just click this one right you can visit their site all of these ones all these of course have a link to the um sorry this was a ad all these have a link to the product site right and on this site if you scroll down to the bottom these ones have it here but if you scroll down the bottom you'll see the product hand badge right and this is what product hunt came up with the batch and this is similar to a trust filed badge right if you go to a restaurant site or any other any other type of site that wants to convey trust most of them display the trust pilot badge right because people and users trust trustpilot right it gives the business that's displaying it three things one is social credit two is Authority and three is pride right website owners and business owners are proud to present their trust pilot reviews right we have almost a five star rating on trustpilot and business owners are proud because they know that users rely heavily and Trust heavily trust Pilots so businesses are prior to this place prop sorry then of course it gives them Authority right if customers Trust trustpilot it gives a business authority to display high score trespass review score right only makes sense and of course social credit as well now what product did was replicate press palettes badge in a way right but tailor it to these little software projects again if you go to this website for example just show the random one they have all these down here they have ones for G2 as well if you don't know G2 essentially is a website that compares different types of software slides so G2 is similar in this doing the same thing right they're acquiring backlinks and I'm sure they have hundreds of million backlinks as well because they have hundreds of million products here and people are probably displaying their little Badges and all these ones right it's something that business owners are proud of that convey to convey stress to the product because people and users trust trustpilot and people and users trust about time too right so this was how they were able to acquire a hundred million backlinks right most of these backlinks come from their own users so their ugc user generated content created backlink right so as a listing website right because essentially product is a listing website they're leveraging their own users to give them backlinks so it's essentially a circle right a closed Circle so you people go on product hunt right they list their product then product handle links out to their user site but then they link back to theirs right so it's an infinite Loop and that's how they're able to leverage their own users to build a hundred million backlinks right super super interesting super super powerful now that's the first thing I want to cover now let's go over how exactly they're leveraging ugc for getting traffic right so we have something we have a lot to cover here so you might see that for all their listings they have a forward slash alternative and four slash question Pages I'm going to show you those right now so if we go here for example to um address we see that a lot of these Pages get 800 600 500 400 so a lot of these all four slash alternative Pages because they have a bunch of them actually they have one for every single product get a lot of traffic of course if you add all these up it's a lot of traffic now what they're doing is they're creating alternative Pages you can see here four slash alternatives for all the tools they have now of course not all the tools are that popular so all the tools are tools where people search for Alternatives in but because they're doing it for all other their tools eventually the more popular or some tools will pop off becoming the more popular ones and people will eventually search for alternatives for example I personally use remove background remove.bg c2l grade two a free tool to remove a background right and let's say maybe I'm not really happy with the with the tool maybe it's too expensive maybe I want the quality I don't know I'm bound to search for an alternative and plot Hunt is capitalizing on all this right all these alternative pages right which you you think how many people search for I don't know resume resume resume awarded to Alternatives or I don't know Carter 2 Alternatives I don't even know what this product is but some people know what it is right so it's important to capitalize on that and that's exactly what they're doing with every single product of theirs now what's more interesting is that on these alternative Pages they're linking to Alternatives that are inside of product and so they keep people inside of product hunt right it's an infinitive infinite Circle super super interesting now if it were me I would add a bit more juice to these Pages maybe add here a FAQ on exactly what the tool does all that just the pages a bit more juice now speaking of FAQ something else that they're doing which I mentioned here is questions right they have FAQs for all their products if you go to product.com for slash questions right you can see here this infinite this is infinite right this is infinite this is like where they aggregate all of their actually maybe not infinite maybe not it's just not loading but this is where they aggregate all or the more popular FAQs every single product listing has for example if I click this one this one and this one these all lead me to the FAQ page for a certain product right our boost sleep bud is too safe if you click here this comes from this product page right again this is a bigger brand but you get my point right all of these I'm trying I'm going to try to open a more uh a smaller brand for example glowforge last right what's this this is a maybe lesser known product but all these FAQs come from the product pages right so they're aggregating all these questions that people might have again people that use these products that you might think that not many people use them right just like the the forward slash Alternatives pages but the same people that are searching for Alternatives may be also searching for questions for a specific product right and if we do this you can see that the amount of traffic you're getting is huge right all these Pages the four slash questions pages are getting a bunch of traffic right if you all add all these up and these not just about the the traffic number here it's about the search intent right because people searching for Alternatives or questions related to a certain product are people that are more willing to purchase something now that's super super important and something that's often overlooked is the search intent right super super important to know and Target keywords that are buyer driven right and again forward slash the the Alternatives pages and the questions pages are Q are our Target Q sorry Target keywords for people that are most likely uh wanting to buy or uh yeah essentially buy something right because why would you be searching for uh questions for a certain product or alternatives for certain product if you weren't looking to at least give it a chance right so super super interesting what they're doing with the forward slash uh questions here as well now moving on and again I is a given right all all sites should have a Blog now they also have a blogger here they target multiple different topics around Tech mostly and if you go here they they call it stories they'll call it blog their blog is getting um almost 5 000 Impressions uh sorry 1200 organic traffic every single month now I do did see that they only started really ramping up the blog uh this year which is interesting right you can see clear uh move up right here I'm sure they started pumping up a bit more content but it's always a valuable thing to do right because yes blogs and or in this case stories uh usually the content on here is less talking about again about a search intent now is less bar intentive I guess but it's still a great way to drive people to the brand collect emails right here of course and then retarget the people so it's super super hard to have a Blog even though the blog is more for informational uh based content so that's what you're doing here with their uh blog pages and that's essentially how product hunt has developed a SEO strategy That Grew them to a hundred plus million backlinks a domain rating of 91 which means essentially that it is a super super powerful domain running traffic of almost 900 000 a month and they were sold to Angel list in 2016 by 20 million dollars right that was uh six years ago so you can imagine how much they're worth now it must be much be sorry much higher than 20 million but super interesting what they've done super interesting that they're leveraging their own Community both for backlinks and for Content as well and the most interesting thing in my opinion is that it is a quote-unquote simple not easy business model but it is a listing site it all all boils down to listen because product hunts essentially is a site where people not them right not product hunt but people users list their own products and then product hunt monetizes this how they want so some sites take a fee some sites ask you to pay uh at least a fee to list your product here right all all there's a different bunch of ways to monetize your listing website but I won't go dive too deep into that I just recorded the video on Airbnb they monetize it through transaction fees but they're more of a Marketplace style listing website uh but yeah and of course still super interesting to take a look at behind their SEO strategy and what they're doing the backlinks they've acquired so again not all the backlinks come from their um their users so not all of them are ugc some of them for example this one comes from WordPress a bunch of ones from Reddit GitHub so they have very very powerful backlinks that don't come necessarily from their users but most of them will come from the users right by the way this tool um it's a good tool if you want to start diving into the sew world to get some key insights on any any domain but the true value of this is this keyword Ram tracker right here which essentially allows you to add unlimited keywords and track unlimited keywords for unlimited domains so super super valuable if you do SEO any type of SEO and you're not tracking your progress you're doing something wrong it's very very important to track your keywords because if you don't track your keyword right if you don't measure it because you cannot track what you don't measure you won't be certain that the backlinks you build the content you created in your rco strategy that two positions you did technical optimizations are having any effect if you're not targeting your keywords every example if you can see here um some of the keywords here forever.com this just serves as an example but yeah some of these are our ranking uh I guess you'd want to mention this uh in this short video yeah that's it if you do or if you're interested somewhat in learning how to create learning but actually creating a listing site like pallet hunt um I'll leave a link for this in the description where we're just developing this right now we'll give you a lifetime access for uh the service which essentially in a couple of minutes allows you to create a directory website with zero transaction fees and limited listings users all that connecting a domain essentially allows you to dive into the business of creating a listing website and making money with it that's our offer that's what I wanted to let you know before I go so I'll leave a link for this in the description if you're interested again into I'm diving a bit into this world of business and listing website business that's that and of course once you you're up and running once your site is up and running your directory side super running you're running some SEO you're going to need to get some organic traffic to it of course yes paid traffic is also a good thing but organic traffic is also great so for that you can use vessel.com you have a bunch of professionals here that know what they're doing you can buy backlinks you can buy content you can have someone develop a tailored that's your strategy for you to rank your your listings higher and higher so yeah that's it for now thank you so much for watching and I'll catch you on the next one cheers.
