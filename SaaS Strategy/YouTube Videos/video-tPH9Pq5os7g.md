hey it's Aiden at leveler and today we're going to be talking about how to create revenue streams within your Discord server so in this video I'm going to be giving you some ideas on what you can do to start driving some Revenue but before we dive into those there are some prerequisites that you should be thinking about before thinking about driving revenue and monetizing now it is so so important that you have fostered a community and built really sort of loyal members that advocate for your community they need to feel connected and they need to feel like the server is providing a purpose that they care about when your community starts to have its own kind of culture you know when there's like inside jokes and there's memes and all these things this is a time when you know that people are really connected to this community and it's around then that you could start to think hey maybe I can monetize this because people will be wanting to support and they will advocate for those things one of the first tactics that you can explore to monetize your Discord server is creating some exclusive content that would provide extra value or maybe behind the scenes or early access to specific things that you offer uh through a membership platform like patreon when you can then link these patreon members to those Discord members you can create a role specific for patreon supporters and that role would give them access to exclusive Channels with exclusive content and one of your concerns might be well what if people are just go go in there and they start sharing things outside well you can always you can always warn them you can always say hey that's not the idea but in the end um when something things get leaked it might actually show the value that you have in those channels which might lead to more people wanting to sign up because they want to see it as it comes live uh and of course with everything comes risk but it's something that I see work very very well in a lot of different Discord servers uh but do think that when creating this exclusive content that you don't want to take away from your free content your free content still has to be really good it has to keep bringing people back and has to keep people happy and excited when you do drop content so perhaps quite an obvious tactic is merchandise uh I'm sure you've been in servers or you've been part of different communities on different platforms like YouTube or twitch where creators brands are providing merchandise uh and this will be stuff that is sort of centered around their brand it's not going to be the main thing that they do but perhaps your community has inside jokes or memes these are things you can definitely go and print onto sweatshirts onto mugs perhaps there are some quotes or some clips that people have gotten from your videos or your live streams that you can then go and turn into merchandise uh it can also be things as simple as your logo really this is a place where you can get creative with I think it's super super exciting to dive into the water of merch because you can really play around have a lot of fun ideas there is a website called fourth wall which I do recommend checking out if you want to quickly and easily set up a merch Shop but you could also achieve this with platforms like SP Spotify I said Spotify not Spotify Shopify merchandise is not the only thing that you can share within your Discord server uh I've seen communities that have gone and create Emoji packs and icon packs these won't be the same emojis that the server uses because of course if you're in that server you can then go into other servers and use those emojis so why would you pay for them uh but there would be more exclusive things uh that people can then take they can bring them into their own servers but make sure that it's not purely just your brand because it needs to be relatable when they use it in another server so just think of like what are some gimmicky ways that you can turn your own content into emojis that can be used sort of in a universal manner so if your community expands outside of the screen outside of its digital space uh let's say you're a musician a comedian an artist and you do real life events think about how you can sell your tickets in your Discord server if you're using platforms like Ticket Master give your Discord Ser uh Early Access to these tickets and there's lots of benefits to this you know you can avoid scalpers on the internet you know the kind of people that sit around refreshing and buying as many tickets as they can so they can resell them you know get it to the Community First get to your most loyal fans first if you use a tool like level of software you're able to get analytics on how many sales you're doing through your Discord server and you're actually properly able to attribute that something thing I'm a big fan of is educational content and workshops now if you're like a guru on a certain thing you could set up small courses or live sessions that people can join that go a little bit deeper to what you provide generally for free um so for example I myself do Discord content perhaps I can sit down with a group of people and do a workshop and I could sell that for a a small price uh this is again something you could set up on a Shopify or through patreon Etc now the last couple ones are things I'm not huge fans of and I think that if you do it you do need to do it very tactfully because it can be seen as selling out uh this is everything from Brand sponsorships to affiliate links if you're pushing stuff that isn't super relevant to your community they're just going to see you as trying to make a quick Buck you know like if I'm doing Discord content and then suddenly I'm trying to push meal prep uh that gets delivered to your house it's like sure maybe you want that but it's not what I'm standing for it's not what the community exists for so it's a little bit random uh but if you're like say a tech reviewer and you're doing reviews on key keyboards and then you get reached out to by a producer of a keyboard that you actually think very highly of of course then that's an opportunity to go and provide discount codes set up affiliate links so there you have it there's a few tips on how to monetize your Discord server uh just a few ideas we didn't dive too deep into each thing but if you would like more information on any one of those on how to set it up how to go about it uh and how to measure those things please feel free to drop a comment reach out uh and of course if you like this content give it a thumb thumbs up give it a like And subscribe to our channel uh we love seeing you back here every week [Music].
