and I don't think you have to be an Insider you don't have to come from that industry to do it you just have to spend the time to learn what what pains they they face how do you think about risk right there's the myth that entrepreneurs are are are Risk Takers and it's not true what are your thoughts on AI I think that Aaron cover welcome to the show thank you it's it's great to be here let's uh let's start off with something pretty spicy what are your thoughts on AI okay so first thing I want to say is I I am not like an ostrich sticking my head in the sand and pretending it doesn't exist so caveat what I'm about to say with that um I so my clients are insurance agents and usually they're they're not the first to adopt new technology but uh news of AI has reached my industry and so people are asking about it you know how do we use it and I I always turn them around and say what what do you want it to do and nobody really knows but I was I was at a a conference it was a a meeting of a bunch of CEOs it's like an executive group I'm a part of and these are CEOs of all different kinds of companies um pretty you know some pretty big you know several hundred million dollar in Revenue companies and you know I'm I'm one of the tiny companies there some old school you know like old trades and Manufacturing and so we're all talking about Ai and so they brought in a speaker to to tell us how AI is going to change their world and one of the things he said is how many of you have a budget for stock photography and of course every every head in the room goes up and he's like well you can just strike that off your budget no more stock photography you could just go to AI to image journey or dolly and tell it what you need and it will create your stock photography and on our platform we license a lot of stock photography for our customers to use and so I was like well that'd be cool if I could not do that anymore so our customers again insurance agents and so I thought what's a picture they might want to use and so I thought about uh agent selling to Medicare customers over 65 and so I said give me a photorealistic image of a 65-year-old couple happily dancing in their kitchen while preparing for a dinner party that's a great photo right you can see that on on the insurance website this happy couple dancing in the kitchen um you know with like a half-cooked meal in the background or something so let me show you got it what's what's wrong with this image if anyone's listening to this uh yeah it's it's there's there's clearly a guy wearing a dress is have they switched around the heads is that the the the the the the females the one on the right's a bit there's nothing wrong with this image um but there there is some context that that is important and and so um yeah we have a guy maybe he's Scottish maybe it's a kilt um but this this is just such a funny thing to me this is like AI in one picture it's like that if you if you stand 50 feet away and squint it looks great but one sh up and close get up close and look at it closely it's it's not ready the shoes look a bit off that doesn't look like a human foot and there's yeah the some of the cuts the the Cs and stuff in the background Sho he's got one high heel shoe and one low low heeled shoe oh jeez um I think there's like a cander hanging on the lamp or something um yeah there is you're right but yeah oh wow it's like The Kilt The Kilt is the thing and I don't said they look pretty old yeah like if I were 65 I want to I want to look fit and handsome and healthy and and they look pretty old it's been a rough 65 for these people rough year so um yeah I'm not gonna I'm not gonna cut my stock photography budget yet awesome so well let's let's just switch context again so just just uh for anyone who's never met you yet um tell me what is Agent methods and who is it for so we make a we make marketing software for Independent Insurance Agents and so our our customers are you're in the US only we only sell the agents in the US but that's it's like your local insurance agent Main Street agent or the person that you buy life or health insurance from and they are the ter term independent is an important thing because that means they don't work for an insurance company so there's there's two types of insurance agents there's the ones who they're called captive and they are representative of one company if you go to if you go to talk to them you'll buy an insurance policy from that company and there's independent agents who can sell any company and so they're going to go and help you find the right product for for what you need they have a problem because because of Regulation because they're independent the insurance companies have very strict rules around what they can do to support okay so they can't provide them with much in terms of Market materials or or client generation materials websites email stuff like that um so they have to do it on their own and these people are salespeople they're they're not web designers they're not marketers they're not copywriters and so our platform helps them do all of that so yeah they have a website builder so we can launch and run the website for them we have email marketing and email automation system social media posting scheduling those are the big ones but kind of the functions they need to run their business and then on top of that we have a Content Library that provides content templates freew written campaigns pre-written newsletters um we do blogging so that all of that work of kind of lighting up their their marketing is taking care of for them fantastic where where are you sitting right now in terms of Revenue and team size so we we are Revenue we we're in the seven figure World um Team size we we in the US we have sales and support and sure product management here there's there are eight of us in the US and then we have um development and some backend support in Asia we have six in Asia and what's the origin story like how did you of all fields did you did you work in Insurance do you have a background in Insurance how did you come up with theide idea how did you come across the problem initially I I was Consulting and so I started my career working for one of the the biggest ad agencies in the US a company called Leo Bernett and if you if you think about any brand that has like a cartoon character mascot it's probably Leo bernet so McDonald's Ronald McDonald uh Rice Krispies the snap crackle pop the Jolly Green Giant you know like so this is like a old School Ad Agency and they had launched a web development arm and so I was hired in to that closely out of college to help them go back to those customers and um launch websites this was in this was in the 90s when this was all new stuff and so we we got to launch um poptarts dcom and mcdonald.com United airlines.com cool um Hallmark you know some some huge Brands and it was it was a great experience I I worked there for about a year and then I sort of you know foolishly said I can do this myself and went off and started doing consulting um on websites website development and I got one client that was an insurance company this this is how it goes with Consulting right you get you get one and then somebody left and went to went to another company and brought me with and then somebody left there and brought me with and I woke up one day and all of my clients were insurance companies I didn't plan on that happening um but it's sort of just you know a space I fell into and I was working with one of those companies and their head of marketing asked me this question which was you know this work that you're doing for us because of all these rules we can't do it for our agents but they really need it do you know of anybody who can help our agents with their online marketing kind of run that for them and of course said no and you went back to work and then the next morning I woke up and was like wait a second wait a second and so I called him up and asked if if I had if I had this solution would he bring it to his agents and his response was when can we schedule the the the webinar with and so we we pushed it out like 90 days give me 90 days about the the the simplest simplest most rudimentary we call it MVP now you know like duct taping chewing gum version and 90 days later we did a did a webinar and uh brought on seven clients wow that first webinar session yeah wow wow and then then you were Off to the Races after that is that the how how did you get your first 100 customers how did you go from seven to 100 yeah so that so 0 to seven was really easy 7 to 100 was was slower because I I got those seven clients and I was like okay we were charging you know way under Christ we we just you know the idea was lowc cost self-service you know easy remove all barriers entry and um so we we got a handful of clients had some billing coming in and then I just went back to work and kind of forgot about it and I had ideas of things I wanted to improve but it really it really wasn't the focus for a long time and so it just sort of kind of simmered and I I think about this a lot with with SAS especially F uh funded SAS there's there's like such an urgency to get to 100 and to grow fast and and we hear a lot about the you know the the rocket ships that take off and you get to $25 million in Revenue in seven months you know this these insane stories I think those are those are the minority the the majority is just kind of a slow simmer and that's how it was for us it was you know we just picked up a client or two here there over time and I don't know when we cost 100 I I don't remember how fast it was but it you know it wasn't because of any kind of magic trick it was because we just were in the market provided a service that people needed and as as we got more exposure we got more signups so you you didn't set out to build uh something for the insurance industry straight away just kind of you know that's just sort of the path that ended up opening up for you do you think a lot of Founders cuz you see a lot of the same ideas getting rebuilt and rebuilt and rebuilt everyone's just trying to build a better mouse trap and it sort of feels like there are lots of other Industries lots of other problems that could be solved and need to be solved but nobody's Building Solutions for them and everyone's kind of competing to build another photo sharing app or another you know yet another social network or yet another me too kind of what are your thoughts on that yeah there's I mean there's so many like consumer kind of ideas I get all these people call me up and say I have this idea where you know you can go in restaurants you can you can get on the waiting list using your cell phone and it's like okay that's that's cool but it's not you it's not a big problem that people are going to pay a lot of money for and I think that we're we're drawn to problems that are in our own space you know so like the whole scratching of your own itch that's a phrase we hear right scratch scratch your own itch I think most of the itches that are um related to like software development or kind of entrepreneurialism are very well scratched at this point and to the point where they might be kind of raw and if you touch them it's gonna hurt so I I don't think it's like that's not to me a good mantra today like scratching your own itch is can be fun it can be inspiring but the there's lots of big problems to solve and and less sexy businesses if you go and look and I don't think you have to be an Insider you don't have to come from that industry to do it you just have to spend the time to learn what what pains they they face every every industry there's tons of unsolved problems to to to tackle there's tons of pain to go and solve but we just have to go and look Beyond kind of where we're at so I I feel pretty strongly about that that um you know if we can get out of our own world a little bit there's so much to do still but but all the all the problems here are already well well solved I think someone said to me once that um so most most SAS businesses are started by people with a background in software it makes makes sense but if you think about the if you're working as a software engineer there's a a finite pool of problems that you're likely to encounter on a day-to-day basis yeah you know that's why you've got something for restaurants maybe go out to dinner that's why there's more software you know yet more developer tools um but but a problem for an insurance agent you're not going to come across unless you're talking to insurance agents unless you happen to be Consulting for them so that's how the Genesis of this fantastic is is there anything that surprised you like what what marketing channels did you did you use were they effective um what what worked and what didn't work for you when when reaching that audience given that you know you kind of came from a different world to to your customers you know the the whole scratching or it or nich thing it it goes Way Beyond the problem that you solve it's it's like how you engage and how you market and I mentioned before my my original Vision was this like lowcost you know because it's like oh cheap so it's an easy decision and self-service so you can go sign up and when we think back to especially consumer or kind of prosumer SAS you see low price points and you see like 30-day free trial you know lots of kind of removing that friction but please don't ever call them don't don't ever reach out and and as sort of a techy person that's how I want to buy also I I want to I don't want to have to talk I don't want to have to get on the phone and do a sales presentation you know forget that schedule a demo I want to go and and you know on my own time without having to speak with anybody do a demo or do a do a trial and and get in and get my hands dirty and play with things and I think to to a lot of tech Founders tech people that makes sense right I mean I I don't know how you want to buy is it you know do you want to get want a sales call with somebody or do you want to just go and try it you're not adding yes I think it's the try it well it's funny that you say this I was talking to Andy Allen from hike SEO uh earlier today and he he was saying so um it's a it's a tool for uh small business owners to do their own SEO it's like a self- thing and he was actually telling a story where they they had a book a demo button in there and that was just the path like from the very beginning it was always book a demo book a demo demo and then someone got sick they weren't able to do it so they they pulled it out and made it self serve and their their conversion rate increased so I think it kind of highlights the point that you really need to know your customer because people buy in different ways and some people want a phone call some people want um to be left alone and just to to to play with the tool themselves I mean I I personally um yeah I I'm like you I'd rather just you know I don't want to talk to anyone let me jump in see if I like it see if it's for me I want to you know try and try and break it I want to use it in Anger first to see you how does it up but a lot of people a lot of the world doesn't work that way yeah I think most of the world doesn't work that way and so this is like we were scratching our own itch I was like let's make it self-service and please don't ever call us and that I I had to I had to learn I had to unlearn that and I had to learn that you know not only do my customers have problems they need solved they they want to be marketed and and sold to in specific ways and and every industry is different there's you the selling SEO tools to small businesses is different than selling tools to insurance agents small businesses but a very specific kind and it wasn't until I dug into that and not just figured out what problems my clients have but how they want to go about learning about solutions for those problems and acquiring products to solve those problems that we would really kind of hit the hit the nail um we had a great product but we w we weren't we weren't connecting with our Market the right way how far into the journey were you before that that Penny dropped and you had that realization embarrassingly [Laughter] far yeah um embarrassed part partially because you know this started as a side project and so it's like well I don't want to have to go on the phone and you know wreck my day with a bunch of sales calls and also at you know 20 bucks a month you can't do sales calls so I was like well I can't afford to do sales calls and so it took a long time of customers you know trying to trying to get us on the phone to realize oh this is what they want and that it's not the price or the ease of signup that they care about it's it's the problem they need solved and when we figured that out we realized that we could charge a lot more because we understood the value of the problem better and that the the price price was not the feature the they were buying it wasn't low price so we we realized that we could we could charge a fair amount you know a appropriate amount for our service and still do live sales Live support live engagement we we added a like like hike we added a button that was the opposite so we had the sign up now or schedule a [Music] demo and this was on our pricing page first and immediately immediately almost 100% of the people chose the demo you know it wasn't 5050 wow it was like in a year hundreds and hundreds of demos and maybe a half a dozen people went in and did the Tria wow it was that clear cut wow it was that clear cut we went a step further and we so then we changed our call to action on our homage from you know try it now to schedule a demo we had pricing on our site you can go and see what it cost and almost none of our prospects had even looked at the pricing page they they were looking at what we did and they wanted to get on the phone and talk to us and they wanted to discuss how we solve their problems and understand that before they car about price so your the the way You' kind of Envision that whole user Journey was was probably backwards you know what what I would think is go to pricing page first if that's in within your budget then you go through and you're like okay now I'll talk to someone or now I'll sign up and give a go but they want to talk to someone first they want to talk to someone first and they want to get their questions answered and they they want to they to to to my customers the live sales demo is much more efficient than just poking around on the own if they can get on a call with somebody my team for half an hour to an hour talk about their business their problem what they're trying to do they'll get the answer they need and make a decision whereas if they get a free trial it's like 14 days of screwing around and not really knowing so and and then they end up churning because they weren't able to figure it out yeah and then they're not successful yeah yeah yeah yeah so if you if you change that around so so so do customers have to go through a demo now how how have you changed your your sales process or your funnel as a result they they do they do have to yeah yeah and it that sounds worse than it is because they all want to but we don't even bother with the self-service because those customers are almost never successful they sign up and then they don't activate they don't they don't get the pieces in place they need to to succeed so um we just shut that channel down because it it it didn't work for us what else did you need to change so once you had that realization that okay we're going to we're going to put people through a demo first um and everyone's going to talk to a salesperson first I mean you you talked about changing your pricing were there there there any other impacts that you noticed did you have to change your onboarding did that affect uh retention like what what did that look like for you yeah you I mean you can kind of like this switch right from Self Service to sales driven you can almost run that through every piece of our funnel and our customer relationship so how our customers do research they they generally don't go to Google and start typing and search queries they don't click on ads and so we were working hard at paperclick doing AdWords we were working hard at SEO and we discovered that those are actually kind of the worst channels for us to get customers because customers that are driven by that self-service research and purchase were tended just not to be the customers that were successful on our platform and so we had to look at you know acquiring customers differently different channels to to to get in front of our market and then the same thing on the success side these are customers who don't go in and figure it out and so we added live onboarding so so every one of our customers and we we charge for this but they go through a onboarding process it's about four hours whoa of one-on-one Zoom calls and so we have an onboarding success team that helps them get activated and that great I mean that goes from that took our success from like 50 or 60% to basically 100% wow because we can make sure that every customer gets everything done they need to get done and and you know we're not quite project managing them but in a sense we are we're we're we call it done with you so we're there with them teaching them how to use our platform and getting all the pieces in place that they need to be successful so at the end of that you know they're not figuring things out they're up and running they're they're they're seeing results they're getting the benefits pieces are in place is that a filter like is is that one way of helping you decide whether this person is going to be a long-term customer or not or do you have other ways of of kind of decid because you know I think I think some people fall into the Trap of um everyone is my customer um and then whenever they see people leave they kind of optimized for the people who leave rather than the people who stay um right so yeah what what are your thoughts on that if you compare a paid onboarding with a live sales demo to a free trial somebody who's invested half hour to an hour in a sales demo or maybe even multiple calls and then paid for onboarding and sat through four hours of that the level investment they have versus somebody who created a free trial is it's there's no comparison and so they're they're more more invested in our product but also you're not going to do that work and pay the onboarding if you're not sure if you are still kicking the tires and and you're you're just not ready to commit um it is a test it is it is like a commitment test and definitely that you know that had huge impacts in our retention because the customers we were bringing on board were were not thinking 30 days out they were thinking one to three years out is there anything else that you you look for that would tend to indicate uh this is the sort of customer that's going to be successful and this is the sort of customer that you know might be better served by using something else instead I was talking to a a relatively new SAS founder a couple weeks ago and he was in the all revenue is good Revenue mindset it's like you know what I even if they churn in 90 days I get 90 days of Billings from so it's it's money and I get that because if you just quit your job and you have rent to pay you need to have billing coming in but on the other hand we're we're building subscription businesses and the subscription kind of by nature is somebody who keeps sub resubscribing to your products so um the value the long-term value of of SAS business is that subscription is is retaining those subscriptions and once you get Beyond just kind of paying your rent every month and you know being able to survive as sast Founders we have to look at what's the value of the organization that we're building and that is based on our long-term retained clients in our client subscriptions so we're now at a point where we don't want those quick turn like those those customers that are going to stay less than a year customers that are coming in and sort of thinking well try it see if it works but they're not really sure um we want them to do more research before they sign up and so we we do push back and so if we if we talk to somebody in a in a sales call we think that they're not ready or they're not a good fit or the problems that we solve are not the problems that they have it's not nailed you know we will tell them no or we will work with them to kind of dig in a little more to make sure that it fits there it's two-way you know it has to be that's for a customer who otherwise is a is a kind of a good qualified customer there's an entire universe of people who who aren't the right fit who aren't qualified and so we've we've developed some tests to kind of pre-qualify our Pipeline and we we know that there's some customers that are just not going to be successful that they're they don't have the pieces in place and their business to see long-term success using ours and so we could say well you know we might get six months or year Revenue out of them but we're not going to get a long-term successful customer and so we we don't want to sell to those customers because that's not what our business is built on how how long did it take you to sort of identify the traits of the the companies that are going to be successful and sorry the businesses that are going to be successful and the businesses that are not going to be successful um like is is that is that years of of data is that phone calls and conversations is that something that you kind of realize my answer is always gonna be too long it all all and maybe because we're all impatient right it's like everything is takes too long but I think that I you know I I have had kind of blinders on and we we we have a way and it took me a long time to recognize good customers and bad customers there's some pretty simple things um we can for us we look at uh how long they've been an insurance agent so if it's less than a year it's it's a really hard job to get started the halflife of a newly licensed insurance agent can you guess how long people if you if you went to Insurance class today and got a license today how long would it be until half of your classmates quit the business oh is this one of those things where they say you know like 90% of small businesses fail within the the first year is is is that kind of a a statistic or is it yeah much faster really so the halflife is 13 weeks whoa oh okay wow so so people go you know and it's it's like I can go sell insurance I'll go try it out that first year is really really hard you you sell a policy to your neighbor and your your mom and a couple friends and then you're just like what do I do now now I'm that annoying guy at the party trying to talk about life insurance or you know ask people about their health insurance it's really it's it's a hard first year third year the fifth year the 10th year become amazing because a once you have a a a client base a book of business you know retained um policy holders it's like a subscription business where you know they keep they keep renewing their policies you know many of the policies will pay commissions on renewal and so there there are agents that you know are are making hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a year just on renewals not all of them but it's out there but that first year sucks and and so they're looking for Holy Grails they're looking for like what can I do and so they see our platform and they hear about what we do and they're like okay maybe this is it and so we you know we have a never ending stream of of brand new agents knocking in our door we're too expensive and they're not going to see the results yet because they don't have the raw material in their own business to to for us to work with and so that's the first filter it's like if you if you haven't been in business for one year year um you know chances are pretty good you're not going to be successful in our platform and the second is the size of the business so how many how many um how many insurance policies have they sold because you can stay in the business for a year and sell six policies if you if you have a spouse that's bringing in your income or something else so we we have those two filters when we came up with this this was last year about a year ago we went and we we kind of created a little grading rubric of how good a customer is you know how strong the fit is based on those criteria and so we went back and looked at all of 2022 every customer that signed up in 2022 we went through and we graded them all one two or three three is like dream customer you know they they are a perfect fit they they check off all the boxes of what we want in a customer two is a base hit a good customer um but not perfect and one is probably doesn't meet our criteria not a great customer so we graded all of our customers at the end of 2022 about 15 months later we had all the threes were still customers so 100% of them were with us wow so the good F of course to them they got the value we were able to deliver what they needed it was it was our price is no-brainer for them compared to what they see in return uh 100% of them are still customers of the twos 15 months later is about 90% so we retained you know more most of them yeah of the ones none were still com wow wow 100% had head churned so that's a a pretty pretty watertight process then for for grading them yeah yeah yeah I think I mean I think in our business that that criteria tells you a lot it's like okay okay so if we're looking for long-term happy customers customers where we're adding long-term value just don't even sell to once somebody you know if the criteria tells us they're one we we tell them you know what we're not the right solution for you or at the point in your business you're not going to see The Return you want so you know if you can if you can do these things call us back and and you know then we can talk about how we can help you I think a lot of a lot of SAS Founders are probably sitting there thinking okay well like I would love to be able to know for sure this kind of customer is still going to be around you know a year later two years later um if I had a better way of identifying them that's that's a concrete tactical thing that I could do that is going to Aid with retention just being able to find the best customers in in in the first place is there anything else like any other spec specific tactics that you use for reducing churn at agent methods yeah I mean the customer criteria thing it's really tough right because I got there after years of data and so we didn't start there and most of us that bootstrap start kind of in the low end of the market so it's you know if if you're bootstrapping a software business you're not going ENT a prise you're going at you know you're going small sales first and that's you know what we found is like those really small unstable businesses are bad businesses and that's that's an obvious thing um but you have to you have to do enough of that to get the data to recognize what it is that makes them bad so it's it's tough it's it's it's tough to tell somebody who's you know brand new starting out you know my story because you know I didn't wake up knowing this it it took a long time to figure it out um but then retention beyond that so so keeping customers long term um I think that's a NeverEnding struggle like every single cancellation is like stabbing my heart I probably should like not even see them I have to look and you it's it's always like you know bit of me dies um we're trying to take a really open mind about that and look at every customer and if we can um get some feedback it's really hard to get feedback from cancel customers Because by the time they've canceled they're done yeah um I've I've tried to do things like where we've tried to like pay people who've canceled to come and talk to us just tell tell us you know what was your process when you decided to cancel what what were you thinking um you we've offered $50 gift cards for a 15minute call and those are really hard to get I thought that'd be a no-brainer but people don't want to talk about it at that point just too bad because we want to learn um but we we do look at the success factors we see customers that are succeeding in our platform are hitting and so we've we track usage we we track their activities and we've we've built a dashboard in our system that shows us customers that are not doing those things and so we we look at it as a as a list of kind of potentially atrisk customers so we you know we have a list of customers that we see they're not hitting all of the criteria that we think they need to hit to be really successful on our platform and it's kind of a by hell or high water how can we get them to to go and change their behavior sometimes they don't need to sometimes we talk to them and like yeah that thing that you're tracking I don't care about that but I love everything else okay and sometimes they're okay um but sometimes they need something and if we can get to them before they think about cancelling if if we can if we can be proactive inste reactive we can help them get that value and so that's that's become a really big Focus for us is is like being proactive you know before turn to go and find customers that need help do you know how long it takes just out of curiosity do you know how long it takes between when you start seeing some warning signs and when they actually cancel like what what's what's the lead time on that is it is it six months is it 12 months out is it a few weeks I don't know I I don't know um and it's probably it's probably like buying things like canceling things is probably a different Journey for like there's a a cancellor journey I I had a I had a mentor who used to say it's it's it's it's almost like breaking up with someone like you you mentally check out long before you actually get around to having a conversation and then and then afterwards if they said oh you know what what did I do wrong you don't really want to have to go and revisit that you've sort of already kind of moved on from there so I understand why it's hard to get them to come back um at the point where they've already already already decided to or well they they long they decided to cancel long before they actually hit the the cancel button um are there any other tactics that you used to reduce churn yes I'm not sure what they are we're trying everything we can um I mean CL retention is is the most important metric I I think it's it's like the number one most important thing and I want it to be zero it will never be zero but we have to we have to as as SAS Founders keep asking ourselves this question of how can we deliver more value to our customers how can we make our product better and improve their lives in their businesses and their results and for us that's you know that's a never- ending Quest that's how can we how can we go and and dig deeper and make it more and more of a no-brainer so you know it's like it's an obvious thing that using our software is is so much better than not that they would never cancel this is this is kind of a Nirvana State y um but it's something that you know we're we're asking ourselves this every day if you had to point to one thing that you've tried that's been really effective um is is it just that being proactive and reaching out to them when you start to see that the the wheels are coming off a little bit is there um any any other churn reduction tactic that you've tried that you could say you know what that that's an absolute winner yeah I mean I even the being proactive thing it's it's hard to it's hard to know I mean our churn has continually gotten better retention so I know that things are working um but I don't I don't know I can't tell you how much that's who that's saved so it's it's hard to point to one thing um you know for us if you if you go back and look at our our recurring Revenue graph the the hockey stick changed you know we hit the hockey stick like the the rate of growth changed and that was when we went to live sales and live on board because getting the right people in so they stay and then making sure they get activated like that's solving churn day one so as opposed to one year from now you know if they're if they're getting value and the system is working on day one that greatly improves their success rate long term so some Founders that have they've got a problem with churn and they're trying to reduce it sometimes they need to look a little bit further up the funnel if they're getting the wrong customers in from the very beginning it's going to be yeah they're on this hamster wheel trying just trying to keep up whereas if they're got the right customers from day one then you know 30-day 90day retention is going to be so much better one attention is going to be so much better um and they're so focused on the you know the point of cancellation if they just looked a little bit further back in time they'd probably have an answer right we if we think about that 2022 where went and graded all of my all of our new customers like if we never sold to those bad fit those one one out of three customers if we just never even sold to them I mean first off today they're not part of our recurring Revenue anyway because they're all gone but then they would never have shown up as churn they you know okay they if we never sold them we that would have our retention in 2022 would have been amazing we said twos and threes in our funnel yeah 90% stayed on or 100% stayed on yeah yeah it'd be better than 90% annually which you know for for a kind of a lower priced monthly business would be great just want to change tech for a moment now um and just just zooming out a little bit so I want to talk about you as as a Founder maybe how your perspective on on building a business has changed over time um how do you think about risk and and managing risk is that something that's changed over time is that something that's still been pretty constant from day one right there's the myth that entrepreneurs are are are Risk Takers and it's not I don't think we're not out recklessly doing things um problem solvers I think that early on like I think about that that phone call where I I called back to that client of mine and said hey if I did this since that that was a risk I didn't know if I could even build the thing May would pay for it um and so I I did take some risks there but I also kind of had nothing to lose and so in those first days when it's it's just like you're kind of getting from zero to one or you know your first 100 customers it's like there is kind of nothing to lose and so you just try everything and so maybe we look risky at that point entrepreneurs are out just kind of you know recklessly trying stuff throwing at the wall seeing what sticks you know just just playing around I know that for us once we found out what's stuck you know once once we got some traction and started getting clients and we had a product that worked then it became like super locked down like don't don't mess with the Golden Goose and so we became super risk adverse and and also we don't have we know we're growing business we didn't have millions of dollars in the bank from from a venture capitalist or somebody else to go and gamble with so we had to stay profitable we had to stay lean so experimenting doing you know trying out new channels and trying out new products and stuff just wasn't on the table for us so I think we got very risk adverse now we're kind of back to risk a little bit because we're we're looking for ways that we can reach our Market faster m we're looking at ways where we can expand the value we create to our customers um and there is there's sort of a barrier to entry of some sales and marketing channels where you have to have enough Revenue to be able to even go play there and so now that we've gotten there like we we did a deal last year um with sort of an influencer type thing and it it cost us like 15 grand and we had no idea if it was going to work or not it did not MH it did not work out gambling $155,000 our first year we're just getting going would have killed us right right and and so so now we have enough going on enough Capital to survive those those mistakes it's a mistake those learnings we can do that and I think that as you know as our steps get bigger as we're trying to cover more territory and move faster we have to we have to make take I gamble is not the right word but we have to we have to try bigger things we have to we have to have to take bigger steps and that that means that we are exposing ourselves to what might look like bigger risk um be almost need to get to a point where you've got the resources where either you can take you know Place bigger bets or you can place a lot more small bets without that syncing the company yeah um yeah I I think when you're first starting out you you've really only got the resources especially if you're bootstrapping to to try a couple of channels before you run out of cash and and you know you got to go back and get a job so um does it almost look kind of you shape like at the beginning you've got nothing to lose so you can swing for the fences and try some stuff because if it doesn't work well you go back to your day job but when you get to a point where you're full time you're all in on this this is this is your income this is what's paying you know what's paying the bills what's paying you know your employees bills you really can't go tinkering with it too much because if you have a few bad bets in a row you know that this is why we know like every SAS founder in the world needs to raise their price right it's like 100% need to raise your price but we're all so paralyzed and afraid because once you have customers that are buying at a price changing that is freaking terrifying yeah it seems so risky it it's it's not but it feels that way and it's it's because we're in that kind of that path where we're starting to get things at work people are paying a paying for our service a certain amount if if we mess with that formula we could scrw everything um if you were to give one piece of advice to other SAS Founders Aaron what what would it be can I give more than one give me a top three okay top three um I think one is be patient and at least if you're if you're bootstrapped you don't this is a marathon not a Sprint and we I know for me I I see all these stories I I hear about these you know I I was joking about that company that goes from zero to 25 million in you know 30 days or whatever you you're always benchmarking Mar marking yourself against these like crazy success stories you don't know what went on there um it takes a long time and sometimes ideas have to have to mature and evolve or your Market has to catch up with you you know sometimes you just have to be patient and I do see people start businesses and then well I tried that it didn't work and it worked worked but they just they hadn't given it time to really get traction um so that's one is it's you know be patient this is this is a marathon not a Sprint um and the other one I think is is kind of what I've been saying throughout our conversation which is um it's the cliche it's like talk to your customers get get to know your customers really well and understand their pain understand how they operate how they buy what the world looks like you know go go sit in their office um you know spend time looking at what they do all day and and um see how they solve problems see how they get help see what they do when they you know when something's not working and all of that information is is so valuable because it's like our product is just a small part of how this fits into our clients's world and the better we understand the interface the the better we can deliver the value that we're trying to deliver to them I think I think that that second piece is it's it's sort of it's it's it's interesting because it's kind of it is a bit of a cliche sometimes and yet even the most experienced Founders that I've met still I'm I'm 100% guilty of this myself we think that we know our customer inside out I don't need to talk to them no no no I've got this I've figured it out but um the world's changed or the customers Chang or or we don't know our customers as well as we think we do um and it's always I I always learn something new every time I talk to to to a customer and so I think that's something that we have to work really proactively at I know people that schedule that in they will block out certain amount of time per month to just pick up the phone and talk to some customers I suppose it's easier in your case if you've got customers that want to get on the phone call bit harder if you're selling Dev tools or something and they're absolutely Avers to getting on a call with anyone um but but I I do I I agree with you I think there's there's there's a lot of value in in talking to customers and understanding things from their perspective a little bit more um because there's always more to learn um Aaron if
