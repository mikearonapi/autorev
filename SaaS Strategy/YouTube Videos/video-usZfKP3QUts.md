## Transcript

welcome back to another YouTube video and today I'm going to be showing you guys what my team does when it comes to SAS keyword research um and also how to scale out a SAS as well um the reason why I'm doing this is because a lot of SAS owners they don't actually Focus that much on scaling out the SEO side and I feel like it's a massively missed opportunity um especially when you look at some absolute Giants such as like wise PayPal Etc um just because I'm showcasing to you guys why's website doesn't mean that you need to have stupids of money that these guys have but the reso strategy does work and you can quickly take away bits off of it and essentially replicate it for your SAS product right so let's take a look at the SAS we or the wise website so as we can see here they have been on a steady growth they're at 3.6 million keywords overall they have got 500,000 that rank in the top three sections and they are getting around 52 million traffic per month through to their website so the grand scheme of things they are doing very well um let's just take a look at overview 1.0 as well um so as we can see here they have been scaling out a lot of um links as well through to their website um but yeah referring domains that are about 44,000 um 9 million referring Pages that's quite a lot um but as you can see very very good growth um on the wise.com website now one sub section that I want to focus on CU I feel like this is going to be a high Roi section that every SAS owner can do literally starting tomorrow unless like you are one of a kind SAS that sells I don't know Pink Fluffy Unicorns right it's just an example that I'm giving but unless you're like a brand new SAS that you are Just One of a Kind this might not work for you but let's um let's get to work on what they actually have started to do so they have got a lot of comparison pages so for example if we take a if we go back to my drawn board um if you guys have watched any of my previous videos you'll know that I do love a nice little drawing right so they've got their homepage but one subsection that we're going to be focusing on today is the comparison Pages um and I think that that for any SAS um you can get a lot of visitors um on your website very quickly so for example W wise um versus PayPal compare wise versus PayPal we can also do stripe for example um or actually do they have strike wise versus let's just look at it wise versus revolute um wise versus monzo wise versus pioner um and very quickly as you can see they do have a lot of comparison pages right so compare PayPal versus wise as you can see they've got a full breakdown so wise it should arrive in two days the exchange rate is a little bit better transfer free the transfer fee is a little bit higher though so just bear that in mind um and they're just being transparent if if PayPal did have a higher or um less um arrival time they actually do list it which is something that I actually quite like to see um so as you can see um in two days within two days um the exchange rate is a lot High better for um for wise again however the transfer fee is better so in every single scenario here um wise doeses beat revolute let's take a look here so we have got um wise versus monzo I'm not certain why the monzo flag is French but the exchange rate is the actual same for both of these so monzo and wise actually that's probably why monzo is powered by wise um the only thing that is slightly a little bit more is the transfer fee so just bear that in mind um then they don't actually have a newer style for payer versus wise um but as you can very quickly see that they have scaled out a lot of verses or comparison Pages now one thing that I want to actually showcase to you guys is the power of these compare pages right so all of their compare Pages um actually fall under the forward SL compare section so as you can see just their um compare section once it loads um basically what we've done is we've set up a filter to Showcase how much um traffic just the compare articles get um I'm hoping HS actually uh doesn't crash on me so it finally loaded um this is what it looks like just for the comparison pages so as you can see here they are getting around 75,000 traffic through to their website 40,000 traffic value so if they actually were planning on running paid ads for these specific keywords that's how much you would need to spend every single month um and again if we take a look here um they have also done like currency exchange exchange rates wise exchange rate um what is the best Euro so they've essentially tried to do as much um as they possibly can so monzo exchange rate so they've actually started um doing separate pages for other brands as well so monzo exchange rate what I'm guessing is is they probably try to funnel people into um people using um wise instead of another competitor so as you can see here yeah they've got a pricing table so then they've got the send with wise even though somebody might have searched for monzo exchange rate so it's very smart what they're doing um they are essentially trying to get as much traffic from their competitors as they possibly can by highlighting any flaws that their competitors have highlighting the pro Pros that they also have as well so I would definitely be looking to do the competitor section on um your website now I will probably do a follow-up video on this because SAS keyword research it falls into various different categories um so for example you could also do like blog articles as well um so like why to use uh monzo or why to use um wise sorry um can I use wise in for example Vietnam can I use wise in America can I use wise in China China etc etc so you could do articles like that as well where people can use uh your product um and again it would essentially start ranking for um that or in some cases what you could also do is if say for example um you know for a fact that you're competitor let's say let's say we are wise we're doing the keyword research for wise let's say they aren't available in Germany you could say is um paper available in Germany no they're not you can however use wise so again you're essentially piggybacking off of your competitor's um search volume to gain more clicks and traffic through to your website so that has been my video on SAS keyword
