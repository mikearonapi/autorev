I think people sort of fundamentally misunderstands the value proposition of a free trial because they focus on the word free and hence think that it's you know free of risk that it's actually costs the customer nothing when in fact it costs the customer a [Music] lot premium or free trials for B2B I would almost always recommend premium free trials are too expensive the logic goes something like this I have a product it's really great but it kind of only shows when you get the chance to use it so what I'll do is that I'll give my customers a free trial so they can go into the product start using it and then if they actually like it they can decide to pay me okay this line of thought works really really well in b2c when you're just like downloading an app and you just like you get to like a pay wall but you can sort of like push the payall to later it's like I don't want to deal with you right now I get into the app and I do my thing and then if I just keep coming back day after day and I keep doing my thing suddenly the pay Wall comes back and then it says now you actually got to pay your free trial is over and give me your money and then you know the the moment of conversion happens and then I do that this translates really really poorly to a B2B context because usage is much more expensive in B2B so whenever you have a proposition to a customer it goes something like this what I'm promising you the probability that is actually true and then subtracted from that all the effort and time and resources you have to put into actually using my product right and um so this is different versions of this exist everywhere on the internet I think Alex hosi has been the one that has sort of most lately promoted like a version of sort of a value formula um I like a lot it it it makes ton of sense but but just think of it this way free isn't actually free unless you know the value is delivered by Magic if you actually have to work out to get the six-pack of the muscles it isn't actually free even though the gym doesn't charge you right because you actually have to spend the time and the effort and the pain to sort of go through the motion to get the outcome that you're trying to get to which is the the fitness body whatever and the same thing applies to an extraordinary degree in B2B software because let's say you're saying well I will create a new workflow system for your product team and it's free trial right what are the chances that your customer is going to change all the ways that they're currently working in the product team to get everyone to use your new workflow system and change everything in on board themselves migrate all the data like reconfigure their products learn a new workflow stream learn a new way of working and then figure out 60 days later that oh it wasn't any good and then abandon everything like that is nowhere near free and I think this is what a lot of people miss when they say free trial because usually what free trial then essentially means is that someone not the user because the user is an entire organization but some one one person that is evaluating the purchase can sort of open up the software and look around right and I would say well why don't you just have a demo for that and even better when if we have this use case the the difference between a free trial and a demo account actually is quite big because usually with a free trial there would be nothing in there I would have to first pull all my data in or you know set everything up or configure a software so that I can use it where you can do all that for a customer in a demo account and just have everything ready and say hey do you want to see how the software Works once it's sort of fully up and running we have a demo account for you it's a Sandbox so everything works you can click around you can destroy it you can delete the data you can reconfigure the solution whatever it is but you get a feel for how it works and you don't have to change your way of working you don't have to actually implement the software into your processes which is what is really sort of the costly thing and if you like the demo account you know then we can talk and I'll try and sell it to and so forth but it isn't sort of a free trial it's not something where I need to commit to something and then suddenly I'm hit by a pay wall I think a much better proposition for B2B Enterprise is to say well we have a version of the product that delivers some value and you get that for free forever so that is a premium version if you have a version or a smaller problem that you can solve and do that for free that can get them engaged maybe they will then you know start to use it but it has to be one of the ways where they can still see the product still get an understanding of it then decide to use it for free then ramp up their usage and then at some point either hit a pay wall or they hit some sort of a a a new use case that extends out of the original one in the premium that will then convert them to paid so this is I think you have some pretty solid data on this as well is that um I think price intelligently uh did a lot of this mostly on on on b2c actually but also on smaller B2B products I think the data set that I saw was a couple years old but but they ran a lot of free trial versus freemium we saw that freemium works way better I would say especially if it is well-designed it works way way better than free trials and and I think the reason that that is so is because yeah because of the costs of free as I just explained and the cost that I don't want to Star something if I know I can't keep using it and I don't want to change my way of working because I don't know if I want to buy it so the customer cust is in a a catch22 they don't want to use before they buy and they don't want to buy before they use and free trial doesn't solve that for them so they just don't use and then they don't buy so instead of having that model of an approach either do premium or just do a a demo account which actually does that a lot better um and at least in my experience that is that is why I very very rarely uh recommend my clients to use any sort of a free trial in B2B SAS so take care and good luck hey there so I create these videos for free so that you can take your great SAS product and turn it into a great SAS business so if you like the video and you got value from it you should of course subscribe to the channel and also tell a friend so write someone and say Hey you know you're in SAS this guy talks about SAS maybe there's something in there for you so that is the only way that this channel actually grows or these videos gets around and this is sort of how I try to provide value to everyone I have a network of clients that I have and I get most of my business from referrals only so the reason I make the videos and write the Books and so forth is actually to just provide value to everyone else because I can only be in one place at a time so my hope with all these videos is just to do more good in the world and if you tell a friend or you share you can help me do that so thank you.
