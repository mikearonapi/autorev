are you struggling to decide how to price your membership whether you're just starting or looking to refine your approach the right pricing model can make or break your success today I'm sharing six proven pricing models that the most successful membership site owners use to grow their businesses and I'll even slip in some Insider tips to help you choose the best one so back in 2008 I co-founded a company called wishless member it went on to become the world's number one membership plug-in for WordPress we're powering over 70,000 online communities and memberships today we have the world's number one course for business owners who want to learn how to launch grow and scale a membership and our membership platform membership. we have thousands of people so we help them every single day and over the years I've learned what works and what doesn't when it comes to pricing your membership so that's why I can't wait to dive in and talk to you about how to create pricing that leads to growth and sustainability so let's walk through the six different types of pricing models we'll start with number one and that is monthly so the benefits of monthly is that this is pretty straightforward and easy to set up it's where your members are paying on a monthly basis to access whatever it is that you are providing inside of your membership now depending on your Market what I will tell you from experience is that if you're in a market that is helps people make money or save money then your monthly price point is probably going to be on AOW low in $50 a month and it could get upwards of $100 a month $200 a month 300 even higher but bottom line if it makes money or saves money $50 or higher if it's more of a hobby market or more of a membership that's teaching people like a skill like painting or playing the guitar generally those price points are going to be somewhere in the range of 20 to $50 a month now that's just a generalization you it's going to be that way all the time but in general it's just going to fall into those price points but a monthly is a great way to start for any membership it is the most popular there are so many examples of it you're probably used to it with paying monthly for like Netflix or Spotify right so it's built right into the psyche of most consumers today because it's the most common pricing model of all for memberships so that brings us to number two so the second pricing model is an annual fee this is where you pay as a consumer once a year to be able to access that membership the most common example would be Amazon Prime we pay an annual fee to be able to access all the Prime benefits every single year so just like monthly uh you're paying on a recurring basis the only difference is instead of paying monthly we're paying annually now the benefit to you as a membership site owner is you are able to generate more money up front in fact my wife and I we launched a new membership for our charity and in order to raise a bunch of money we only sold the annual ual subscription and that allowed us to generate literally nearly $40,000 upfront so that's the benefit of an annual subscription the downside though of an annual subscription is that when it comes time for Renewal it is really important that you reflect back to your members the value that they've received over the entire year most often they're only going to look back on the value they received last month and you want to remind them of the value they received all year long you know who does a great job of this Spotify or pelaton because they do those wrapped where they reflect back to you all the music that you've listened to over the years or all the classes that you've taken on the pelaton over the year that's reflecting back to you the value you've received over the entire year very important for renewals okay that brings us to the third one so number three is monthly plus annual as an option so Therefore your potential members have the choice do they want to pay on a monthly basis or an annual basis it's really combining the best of both of these into the same offer now here's the pro tip on this is if you are structuring this I love to recommend that you structure annual as a discount so let's say monthly is $30 a month well over the course of the year that would be $360 for the year you can incentivize annual incen izing people to sign up for that annual subscription by giving them two months for free so this might be $30 a month this might be $300 for the Year this is exactly what we do in both our membership and even our software at membership. we provide an incentive for people to select the annual option you can include both giving members the option for both if people want to pay all upfront then great sometimes members want to kind of dip their toe in first and join on a monthly basis and you've got that option for them there as well so that's the third one monthly and annual number four is a one-time fee now let me be clear I do not recommend this one at all because it is not really a membership there's no recurring Revenue coming from that membership so when I see people who offer a lifetime membership for a one-time fee I am smacking my head because I'm thinking what are they doing because here's the benefit is yes you'll get some upfront cash the downside is you're on the hook to support people inside of a membership and you have no new Revenue coming from that member the only way support the uh ongoing cost of that is from new members and I actually made this mistake myself in my early years and very quickly after six months in we realized that is not a sustainable business model and I don't recommend you do the same so a one-time fee is not a membership that's just a product so don't mistake that because you're getting the worst of the worst in that scenario where you're getting money up front which is good but the downside is you're on the hook now for a lifetime and you have no new Revenue coming in to pay for those support costs so don't recommend a one-time fee all right the next one I want to share with you is upfront fee plus monthly so the concept here is pretty straightforward members pay a upfront fee and then there's a recurring fee that they would pay on a monthly basis now the reason why you may want to structure your pricing this way is because it's to incentivize people to join and not leave because if they leave then when they come back they're going to have to pay that upfront fee again so it can work very effectively as a retention strategy the downside is it's certainly going to impact your conversions on the front end because the upfront fee can also serve as a way to you know discourage people from joining it's one of those like six one way half a dozen the other it works great from a retention standpoint it doesn't work great from a conversion standpoint but here's what I do know from experience when people join a membership where there's an upfront fee and monthly they generally are going to be a much higher quality member of your membership because they know that this membership is going to to provide value for them there's a reason that they're joining that's why they're willing to pay the upfront fee so as much as it can discourage people upfront it can also act as a filter ensuring that you get the best members joining your membership a great example of upfront fee plus monthly would be like a nutritionist where maybe they're working with clients upfront where they're doing a whole bunch of work so the upfront fee helps offset that work and then there's the ongoing maintenance with the monthly peleton also does a great job of this too right where you pay the upfront fee for the bike itself and then you've got the monthly ongoing fee for the membership so this works well if you've got a bunch of costs upfront in the delivery of your membership helps offset that a whole lot okay last one that I want to share with you low dollar trial plus monthly fee so normally I don't like trials and the reason being is in the membership world what we typically see is high turnover of members so we see a lot of people joining and then a lot of people leaving so typically I do not like trials but the one time that I do recommend trials is on the back end of a promotion maybe the promotion is you know moving your monthly or your annual options and then you have a down sell promotion right afterwards for everybody that did not join and it gives people the option to be able to try the membership out for a low dooll trial for a very short period of time so maybe it's a dollar for 3 Days access and you might be thinking yeah but Ste like they're going to join and then they're going to leave well here's the thing I don't mind as long as they're joining and then we knock their socks off while they're there but the reason that I like doing it on the back end of a promotion is now they've seen and the value we've established the value up here and so in their mind it's not like this throwaway offer that trial has real value because they seen it being positioned uh earlier in the promotion so as an example with one of the memberships that I was a co-founder in many years ago we did this on the back of a promotion and we had about 700 this is back of the napkin math about 700 people sign up for the low dollar trial and then about 400 of them stayed on as a monthly member so that'll give you some metrics now that's a very good trial to you know conversion of a paying member typically the numbers are going to be a lot higher in terms of the turnover so again you're just going to want to watch your numbers in terms of the number of people joining that trial and number of members staying but my recommendation is make it a low dollar amount maybe one two $3 and then make the trial period very short don't make it 30 days make it you know somewhere between 3 to 5 days yes I've seen a 7-Day trial that can work too but I like keeping the trial a lot shorter uh than longer so bow doll trials plus monthly after the trial it then automatically rolls in to the regular monthly billing just like the monthly option would up here so there you have it my friends six pricing options you've got your standard monthly and annual then you've got your monthly and annual as an option the onetime fee which is not really a pricing model for any kind of membership then you've got your upfront fee plus your monthly and then you've got your low dollar trial Plus monthly now that you know these six pricing models the next step is choosing the model that feels like the best fit for you and then setting a price that reflects the true value of your membership and if you want a little more help on exactly how to do that I've created a downloadable membership pricing guide and cheat sheet that walks you through how to price your membership step by step while avoiding common pitfalls you can grab it using the link below and if you're ready to level up your pricing strategy even even more and check out this video next where I share how the most successful
