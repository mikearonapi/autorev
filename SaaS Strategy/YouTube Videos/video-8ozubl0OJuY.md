check out their free virtual hiring fair september 20th to 22nd and get to meet hundreds of remote engineers that could be great for your company i'm super excited for today's session kyle's tweet prompted this he said in the past software companies established their brand bonafide the old-fashioned way through marketing now users are the brands people respond to people look to folks they trust for advice basically brands of yesterday were built on what they told the world about themselves and brands of the future will be built on what the community says about them i've been a big fan of kyle the way i describe kyle is he is a one sas gartner and he was recently a keynote speaker and hosted a couple of great sessions at our in-person traction conference in vancouver kyle poyer partner at openview thank you for joining us again yeah excited for more collaboration awesome awesome so that tweet what prompted that tweet well there's been a lot of talk lately about community-led growth uh it's sort of a buzz where everyone wants to build a community these days and i try to step back and think about what's changed like why is this getting to be so popular what's different about the world and what's different about building companies and uh reflecting on it we're in a so we're in uh a new era of product led growth product like growth was coined about six years ago uh by my colleague blake uh blake bartlett and it's this idea of building products for the end user really leading with self-service experiences allowing folks to try before they buy uh and then you know expand from the bottom up in this current environment it's fascinating to see companies really take that ethos of product led and take it to you know as far as it can go right and so increasingly folks are saying hey a plg strategy actually means a lot more than we thought it meant it means that now users are going out they're discovering products a lot of times the products fit within their existing workflow or embedded in their existing tools rather than forcing them to go and seek out a new destination these products are making it easy for citizen developers or individual users to customize or kind of create their own apps create their own experiences to really like create the tech stack that they want to see even if they're not a software developer and then because folks have really built exactly what they want they really feel attached to these products like they had a hand in developing them right uh and so they go to bat for the products they they love they talk them up they share their you know notion set up on twitter uh they tell their friends and so they not only spread the products that they love within their organizations but they really build a community around the products that they love and then that becomes the foundation for ongoing really healthy growth is that you know users talk to other users and uh all of a sudden that uh the users are essentially the face of the brand more so than you know the company's marketing or pr team and so it's been fascinating to just see this it's really like the story of plg playing out to its natural conclusion and community is not a new thing right so if you look at it this last two years so many vcs have reached out to me and friends like hey talk to us about community give us your playbook we effectively boast was bootstrapped to eight figures in revenue with building this traction community and i'm like hey if you're asking for community in 2022 you're already too late because you're looking at hey how do i how do i turn this to drive more leads right and if you look at some of the greatest companies or iconic brands out there even non-tech you look at harley davidson they almost went bankrupt in the 80s then they came back and rebuilt the company around the uh culture of and ethos of community starting with harley writing clubs and in person and then if you take that to hubspot and gain side they create categories with community like before they even had a product they had the inbound community they had the customer success community and that drove a product in a in a big way because they were enabling their audience to become successful without a product or service and then if you also look at it yesterday's innovation in a way always becomes today's option and tomorrow's commodity right like you look at the gps it was a new thing you can get your hands on it and then it became an option and today you got car play and you don't really need it but my philosophy from studying all these people is if you build a community you won't become a commodity you'll constantly get those raving fans will give you the feedback to make your product better and like you said go to bat for you so so i love that building that audience and that community that goes to bat for you so you know let's dive a little bit here uh you said community is an incredible multiplier on a plg strategy and can be applied to nearly every plt business what are some areas of business you see community impact like i mean marketing products cs finance let's dive into some of those i mean ideally it could impact just about every uh metric in function in a business although i think a caveat that i'll just share is that folks shouldn't uh build community on the basis of what kpis it's going to improve for you you need to build a community with and for your users or your audience and so if it's really explicitly about your own objectives the kind of counter intuitive finding is that you're probably never actually going to meet your objectives because it needs to be actually community driven that said uh when when we see successful communities they first and foremost help with tap a funnel your users go help recruit new users they share your product with other people bring folks in to hear about your brand and all the great things they can do with your product i find it it's really helpful for activation and time to value because your users provide support for other folks they build templates they share how they see value in their products which really helps inspire other people and it helps them both have peace of mind that the product's easy to use but then also helps them understand like if there's an infinite number of ways to use a product for instance like air table or like notion or like web flow uh if you have someone that you trust has a setup or has a kind of template or has a playbook uh that really motivates you um well all of a sudden you've been able to you know copy that playbook as opposed to starting it all from scratch so you get to value a lot faster i also tend to find it's great for customer support because your users are able to help other users by sharing best practices sharing how how they got unstuck when they ran into certain issues and then i think the the last thing is that because there's so much conversation that happens around community you're actually creating a lot of user-generated content that helps your product get found by folks outside of the community through seo through organic search that kind of thing and all of that produces lower customer acquisition costs uh better conversion funnel metrics and then you know hopefully better retention dynamics as well so an overall much more kind of efficient go to market motion or unit economics for a company that's you know really doubling down on community yeah and and if founders and companies are jumping on it and looking at for a two three four month roi i almost tell them like don't do it it you can't build and scale a community into three months it's not like running ads or putting sdrs on it you got to look at your community i feel like a product led motion in its own right maybe picking one activity to get people to rally or engage around maybe it's an event maybe it's a webinar series maybe it's a podcast maybe it is a forum whatever it is but people should come in and be onboarded so they get an aha moment and they want to come back like what what brings them in what gets them to keep coming back what gets them to bring their friends and then the the money follows because you get sort of that brand love and you keep hearing about it everywhere so i like that it ultimately impacts finance but it's likely not a first three six months thing absolutely yeah well and i think a lot of folks jump straight to all right we need a slack forum or like we need we need x and they jump to what the answer is uh when the the best way to start is to understand hey what actually is needed by the folks that you're trying to observe uh what are their pain points like how can you add value to their lives um and it might be actually uh that there's existing communities where these folks already live but these existing communities are you know not fully serving their needs and so you could actually be a truly trusted voice within communities where folks already live rather than starting your own that's that is normally a more efficient or sort of like faster uh way to see results from community but then when you start unpacking all right well if if users don't have this community maybe we're starting a new category so like we're hubspot we want to create this term inbound marketing we want to help people understand how to do this well you need to really provide a way to help connect users with their peers so people that are trying to do it in other organizations share best practices amplify the voices of those thought leaders that everyone really looks up to and you essentially play the role of connector connecting people to the essentially skills the resources and the people that they need to be successful and the whole thing is it's not necessarily connecting them to your product it's about thinking about the broader way that you can add value to these folks working lives and it's usually really hard to bite off all of that at once and so start with like a wedge that you can deliver on you can get people to really trust you um and then ideally build with your community so what are people raising their hand for what are they asking asking for help with uh do they want to get involved and contribute and how can you enable them to really own the community and kind of build it out on your uh with you rather than thinking of it as like something that you're building top down for example and just one small example uh i have been noticing that a lot of software companies are struggling with usage-based pricing it's been a hot topic lately it's not something that's super well understood and it requires changes to how you run the business how you manage rev-ops how you do billing how you forecast or predict your business uh there's so many changes and uh a lot of folks kept reaching out to me asking for help or or answers for certain questions but then the questions really became it being clear people wanted to talk to other people uh that have been in the same situation and they didn't necessarily need answers they wanted to commiserate they wanted to talk through like hey i'm considering a versus b what do you think about it and so instead of yeah thinking about it as something that hey you know we've got to write a bunch of content or how to have a bunch of answers for people i just uh decided to collaborate with some of these people that were raising their hand and start a community for executives at uh company scaling with the usage based model and we're now up to hundreds of folks it's super active group we meet once a month uh the engagement level is extremely high but it's not because i had an idea that i wanted to start this community it was because people were really craving it and i uh really listened to who what people were asking for and the community was a solution to that real need that existed you know as i studied a whole bunch of communities from harley davidson to nike to hubspot the one thing i found is when you don't have product market fit or in the early days communities are formed around practice right like usage based pricing you're helping people understand and become better at usage-based pricing or hubspot there's no product there they're helping people become better marketers helping them go online like i'm an engineer and my first job was in product but because it was a startup i needed to learn marketing and everything i learned about online and digital marketing seo was from hubspot they didn't even have a product and one day they took that feedback and they said hey we have a we have a product now right and so i've seen that like pre-product market fit when there's no category existing you're building a community around practice and then eventually you know you evolve into this in this product and then you have a sub community in there but let's unpack this usage based pricing community that that you build starting with first what is a community anyway right a lot of people have a huge audience and they call it community but there's one thing you said there that i really loved is people used to come to me like you're an influencer in the sas space and you had this massive audience you built a lot a lot of thought leadership around usage-based pricing and and so i guess that was an audience but then then you said people wanted to just commiserate and connect with each other and so then you form this community so how is is that the line then people connecting with each other versus one-to-many absolutely it's not yeah it cannot be top-down it's not my voice it's not you know me trying to you know say hey from above here's the best practice or here's what you should do it's really giving people the chance to partner with one another find people that are passionate about this like find their tribe and get better at their job and what they're trying to do as a company and so for for this community specifically i think key key learnings for me were it needed to be really high quality people so it's invite only it's a private group wanted everyone that was part of it to be passionate about wanting to be part of it first off and to be the kind of person that other people would want to me want to learn from and so everyone actually plays a dual role of both having experience that they can share back with others and trying to learn from others and so i think this is this was a key thing it's not necessarily about the size of a of a group in fact like too large of a group can get noisy and can actually get less and less valuable at scale uh and so for me the goals were make sure to focus on quality over quantity uh prove out that this can be really helpful for people and really start with this mvp of a relatively small group of people that's especially engaged and then have them really bring other people in um and and really listen to what they're looking for what they need help with and i can play the role of you know helping facilitate helping bring in experts or helping nominate folks from the community to lead workshops or lead virtual sessions for other people but it's not my voice it's it's trying to listen and take what's happening from the members themselves and then really provide resources or that you know that facilitation to make it all happen what is a community called uh it's the ubp mastermind group but it's not online there's no website there's no it's uh it's really specifically a private group because also a lot of these companies if you're talking about a publicly traded company that has a usage-based model they don't necessarily want their struggles or like what they're going through to be you know shared with the rest of the world and so i think a lot of learning for me was if i was thinking about it from my personal objective right it would be hey let's make this as big as possible it could have you know a brand impact for open view right but that's not actually going to be what the community wants and what helps them achieve success like in their companies and in their specific roles uh and so that you know hence making it you know uh making it something that is really um limited to the people that uh want to be involved and allowing people to feel like they can uh have trust with the other members of the group fantastic yeah i like it because you had you know nail it then scale it right in the beginning do small make a small group of people very very happy so your maniacal focus on an icp that's very specific and there's there's some overlap there and perhaps as this scales and there are more ubp professionals in the world than you can have a sub community that's a funnel for everyone and then you still have this very small focus group but how did you see it in the beginning and when you say mastermind group what activity did you use to bring it in the beginning so like how did you like nail who these people are gonna be and how do you get them interested and what was that key sort of event or activity that your your you brought people together and then sustained it well it was really a uh no maybe yes kind of approach like my default was don't do it don't waste your time uh plenty of other things on my plate like it it's something that i wasn't trying to to push on anyone in fact like if it didn't work out i was gonna be that yes because that means i didn't have to do anything uh but it's something that i was asked by multiple people uh about this it kept coming up on calls with folks and so then i pinged about uh 20 25 folks in my network who had maybe reached out to me about uc space pricing or who had been kind of talking about it externally and i just sent them all an email that said hey um i've you know been kind of hearing questions about starting a group for for folks that are really passionate about this topic uh a like are you interested in being part of it and no is a totally acceptable answer b like what specific topics would you want covered and like what would you be trying to get out of it and then uh see are there any other people in your network that you would want to nominate to be part of it and so i sent that out to about 25 people within a matter of hours if not days uh 80 of them responded and these are you know executives and sometimes founders at successful companies 80 of them responded like yes absolutely when can we start this and so it was really clear that there was a lot of pull from folks that wanted to be part of it and then even when you're thinking about scaling it i was pretty adamant about not wanting a slack room because slack in my experience is not built for some of these communities that are uh relatively large with you know uh well we can get into this but i don't think slack was actually built to be super community driven so my mindset was we're not going to have a slack group it's really just going to be we're going to meet up for like zoom-based sessions or in-person sessions um in local areas and not have a have an online component but then folks kept asking hey actually like we want to meet outside of sessions and want to send a quick note that's you know gets faster answers or something that we can collaborate on and we also want some of these questions and answers saved for future reference and so folks pulled me into uh giving up on that idea of not having a slack group uh and we now have it but i think that i think that was an important learning for me was start with no start with thinking that it's a bad idea and really listen to uh feedback and hear the pull from what folks are actually looking for and have that drive your decision making on where to go and how to scale it that is perfect because a lot of people think building a community is something completely different and and needs a whole set of new tactics building a community is not different than building a company or building a product you start with an ideal customer profile you nail down how to wow them you start small you make them happy and you get their feedback you you pull basically you get them to beg for something and you give them more and then you scale from there but people expect community be something completely different and then ask hey should i start a slack group or a facebook group the world doesn't need the millionth facebook or slack group right i mean you said it at the beginning you can hop into maybe a subreddit or you can hop into an existing group and see what the underserved need there and and create a community within there as a start but i love this you you already had an audience and you pulled your friends and they said it's a great idea they invited more friends you created this zoom based meetup and they had a great experience you pulled even the topics from the audience and so for the next one you probably already had it scheduled and had more topics and now that turns into in-person events and then you got the community to beg you to create a slack group which they could likely pull as a channel in their company slacks to collaborate and and commensurate and message each other off between two events and one of the things i also liked is the cadence rights a lot of people they say community they do one webinar the day one event and they and they stop and i think the cadence is really important to keep that going touch on that a little bit on you guys cadence yeah the cadence uh still fine-tuning it but found that a monthly uh cadence works relatively well uh it's enough frequency that you know it it stays top of mind for people but it's not overwhelming it's not like weekly or bi-weekly that it just becomes a chore for folks i want people to be really looking forward to the next one we've also found hour-long sessions work well because people want to dive into the details and we want to provide space for folks to not just ask questions of you know experts or what you know other companies are doing but to actually share their experience as well and so every session shouldn't be one speaker talking it should be a really collaborative session and you need time in order to facilitate that uh and then we found that uh there's just an endless number of topics and so i also went in being like all right there's maybe six or seven topics that are going to be top of mind that seem to be most popular but what's funny is every time we have one of these sessions about three or four new ideas get added to the list because there are things that folks start talking about that we have to shut down discussion on and it's like all right we've got to schedule another session to keep going and so we're constantly kind of pulled in to make sure that we keep scheduling these sessions and and that to me is also a sign that this is something that uh people actually are are finding value in and uh wanting to contribute to and so uh again i'm constantly looking for reasons not to do it that's amazing he pulled in to actually actually facilitate it yeah when when people ask for more right i guess that's a sign of product market fit and you got to say no a lot like you know i guess success is more what you say no to than what you say yes to because you say yes to everything and spread too thin and you become an sort of inch deep and a mile wide and then you please nobody so i love that what did your onboarding experience look like what was the the aha moment that you know when people you got this invite they signed up you hosted that first um sort of meetup or mastermind and they were like wow i want to keep coming back to this i want to bring my friends it's well uh it's not scalable right now to be totally transparent i think we started with yeah we started with about 40 or 50 people and uh attendance at the first session we got like 30 of the almost 50 to join an hour-long zoom call which is just really challenging to do uh but then those members have invited other members uh i've actually started getting like founders of unicorn companies reaching out saying hey could i join this group i've heard about it from one of the members uh so when that happens when we add new members it's a manual process right now so everyone has to be nominated by another member and they send me the nomination and then i uh personally on board actually every new person shared that calendar invite for the next session we've got a kind of master planning document that has all of the members uh it's searchable so that people can can reach out to other people and it has all of the the backlog of past topics that we've we've gone through uh along with the learning from them and so the the onboarding is uh kind of person to person right now if we if we do try to aim to make it significantly larger i'll need to rethink it but for now i think that personal touch that personal connection knowing folks knowing me and getting um and really feeling like they're part of something uh it goes a long way in terms of making sure people feel like they can contribute um and they can this is something that you know isn't just going to be a community that they're you know part of the name only but they actually feel like a you know an engaged member of it and then the other thing whenever we have a new session we try to make time for new folks to say hi introduce themselves it we used to have time for people to do that at the beginning of the call uh now there's enough new people joining that people just introduce themselves over the zoom chat but it's at least you know getting them get getting their name out there getting them seen uh and then the uh the other thing is whenever we have community sessions we ask everyone you know within reason to be on video and that's something where you know it's hard to have 60 70 people on zoom on video uh but people being able to see everyone else's faces being able to ask questions live uh it just creates more of that connection um and it facilitates i think a lot of dialogue outside of the kind of formal sessions that we do and so to me that's also important is that i don't want this to feel like a webinar or like you know uh that it's coming from top down really need everyone to be an active participant or you know they shouldn't be part of the group definitely so it's almost like maybe a clubhouse or a twitter spaces a chat where everyone gets to contribute raise their hands talk to each other kind of thing or you go like round robin like how do you what is the format of that mastermind the format is uh we nominate someone to facilitate uh each each each session so normally pick a topic and then someone that we think is like particularly well suited to speak to that topic and then i'll generally see the discussion with a few questions uh but i'll email everyone in the group to add questions to a google doc um going in and then there's still plenty of time for folks to add additional questions live or additional topics live but that way we kind of break the ice pretty well like people look at it's helpful for people to hear some of the stories that hear the background of uh that facilitator you know and that additional context helps people really consider uh what to ask about but then at a certain point it really goes off the rails and so needs kind of raining in but uh initially it's uh kind of going through those initial questions from the google doc and then all of a sudden it's um oh hey so-and-so actually has a really great experience with that could you speak to this question or hey i know you asked the question but maybe why don't you share additional context on how you're handling this today and you know what's working about it what's not working about it and so we're constantly trying to think about uh ways to make every session two-sided even though there is one uh there has been one person kind of nominated to facilitate and kind of play the role of of the expert each time awesome you know there's a few golden nuggets right there because you're you're facilitating two-way interaction but then a big part of sometimes why people do things in the community is you're like rewarding your champions or you're recognizing them and and you're you're sort of giving them leadership roles so now it creates this whole this person is facilitating and and sharing um it creates that vibe that this person is given the soapbox or the stage and creates that recognition next time it's going to be me and that person gets to nominate the next person or whatever so people are looking forward to that that that sort of maybe in a way gets people hooked right like you look at neriel's hooked model is what is the internal external trigger what's the minimum investment they make what's the variable reward and then what gets them to keep completing that cycle so i try to look at it from that framework that's that's amazing so like you know if i if it was me i'm part of a group and i see somebody nominated then the next time i'm like oh maybe hopefully someday i'll get to nominate and facilitate but then this can go so many ways because as this grows maybe there's a minimum viable size of mastermind group that you know when you go beyond that size it exceeds it loses meaning it's it diminishes the value and so maybe you can nominate members from your group to create different sub-mastermind groups and all of a sudden maybe at scale you have hundreds of mastermind groups with 20 30 people meeting on a regular basis and then eventually it turns into a big ubp conference with swag and and retreats and next thing you know it's it's a few years down the road like exactly what gainsight did right with customer success yeah i think that's if if we wanted to scale and get get bigger i think that's the only way right because these need to these sessions need to be small enough and focused enough that people really feel like uh they're with their peers and these people get them and so to me chapters end up being natural it's either by location or i think in a lot of cases it's by stage of company like the series a series b companies are really thinking about different things from the later stage companies or it's by type of company so the company selling to a developer right in the devops space in those businesses like you know think about your aws's uh usage-based pricing is fairly commonplace it's kind of been around for a while but there's other markets where it's new and they're kind of educating uh procurement teams about how to buy in a totally different way from what they're used to and so you can start thinking about interesting ways to segment these audiences into some chapters and then all of a sudden these chapters are going to feel uh even more relevant even more personalized to the members because they're they're talking to folks that like get really viscerally the exact thing that they're going through i love it you're involving your community and and that drives more engagement and eventually keeps the door open for building or scaling it to something massive and potentially maybe a product idea or two comes out of it and then we see you starting a company a product land community-led maybe product-led community-led and maybe in the web i'm not that yeah i feel like that is like the vc dream right uh all the all the you got all the buzzwords in there i mean i think the other thing i would share so uh this is something that uh is a side project for me and it's just been driven by the need but before this i think i saw personally the power of community through the work with product like growth and so the plg is a term that uh openview coin and by colleague blakecoin in 2016 and initially uh we were like just super proud that we had uh the top page of google everything about product like growth was something we wrote we were like we're killing it we own google like we are the thought leader in this topic and it was we thought that it was sort of this owned branded term and uh it was a really great way of showing that we were experts as a firm well it turns out like the reason why we had the whole first page of google was because no one was talking about it no one was searching for it and it was writing about it and that that mindset only took us so far right it was actually very limiting and we started to see other people wanting to get involved wanting to talk about being a platform to enable product led growth or wanting to be a consulting firm or a training firm that helped teach people how to do plg and initially it was like oh they're you know they're going gonna take our spot our number one position on google uh and so we were a little fearful but it eventually we really embraced that um proliferation of voices and really tried to uh try to showcase the perspectives or amplify the perspectives of some of these other people um and really try to foster a lot more community because the only way to make something really um meaningful that like changes people um and and gets people excited about something is to uh not really treat it as something that's closed or that it's limited but to really be open about it um and uh and i think for for us that was a key uh aha moment of getting product lead growth to go from something that like was a you know term that we liked to now it's just something that's become like a household term in software and that would not have been possible without so much work from so many community members that are really playing an active role you know ultimately openness is the biggest enabler of growth and if you look at it when multiple people are attached to the same mission you go from category creation and community creation to something beyond you actually become a movement and you know you guys must be really proud and should be really proud that plg is no longer a category it's no longer a community it's a movement there's like thousands of people attached to that mission and you know if you see what nike did was celebrating athletes and athletics they don't talk about the anti-wicking technology in their shoes they talk they celebrate that and now all the other brands are celebrating athletes and athletics and it's become a movement hubspot similar with digital marketing right um and so so i think that is a key thing is that is that openness because then you got multiple communities attaching to it and that that mission becomes a movement here i want to ask you on your onboarding though you had this new community you said you personalized it i love that personal touch because that personal touch also if you if you build this community of 1 to 20 30 right this mastermind group and then you recruit members that is actually potentially scalable that personal touch one to twenty it's not scalable one to five hundred or hundred what are some specific actions you did in that onboarding just people to make people feel like wow this is i don't want to disappoint kyle so i'm going to show up well it's i know i have not cracked the code on that for sure uh but you know all of these folks that are joining they have someone that has nominated them that's brought them in that's introduced them to me so that uh they have that connection right they're already part of it because they already know people that are in it and who have spoken highly of it they get that note for me and sometimes it's even hopping on a quick 15 minute 20 minute 30 minute call first uh you know not everyone's interested in that or like we don't always have time but when possible that's a great uh additional step and then i think just that that note from me about hey welcome to the group here's what we have coming up next that you can be a part of uh this is happening in two weeks i'm gonna send you the calendar invite uh hear your peers who are coming i think just uh you know it's a not that complicated of a thing to do uh but even just that simple step goes a long way in getting people to actually commit and be part of it yeah eventually people build enough of a bond with you that they genuinely is like you know i don't want to disappoint kyle i'm i'm gonna show up when it's like this mass audience coming then you know people drop off and they they don't kind of care but you're building that one-to-one connection is is almost like you know an example of customer success to drive community retention and building a community is so much like building a product if you if you take it seriously so speaking of that what are some metrics to measure kpis like what should people stay on top of you recommend uh it's a great question so i'd say first off like don't be overly focused on the volume of people in your community uh because i think volume itself is a bit of a vanity metric and we've all made that mistake at some point of like this is getting really big like this is great uh focus more on uh engagement and how many members are actually engaged in the community how many folks are coming up are showing up at events contributing their voice speaking in forums and so on for software companies once you've really nailed that the next thing to think about and to look at are signals that you can invest further around community or that community is actually a viable business strategy because i think for a lot of folks it's really hard for community managers or community leaders to convince their boss that this is actually a great roi and adding value to the business so i start looking at other metrics that you can start to be able to make the case uh to the team about uh the business impact without you know obviously diluting the community so can you show uh traffic to the website that uh started with the community as a referral source for example uh or can you show a community qualified leads of folks that can come sign up for your product or request a demo that actually there they were initiated from the community as that first touch point uh rather than you know being touched by you know for instance marketing campaigns and that to me is the the holy grail because when you can start to demonstrate that you'll often find these community qualified leads are uh they convert at higher rates they uh you know because they they already trust you they already know you they have better retention rates uh and uh they end up just being uh just a really efficient code of market motion and so if you can demonstrate that to your um to your leadership or to your board then all of a sudden there's going to be a lot of people that are much more interested in you thank you resources to expand the community if you can't prove that um it it's something that uh i think that could it there's a chance that community becomes something that was the flash in the pan and can kind of die out from from neglect uh because a lot of times it's it's something that is harder to measure um or it is something that feels amorphous or uh fluffy and so in times right like right now when vc dollars are harder to come by everyone's tagging their belt there's a chance the community could be the thing that's on the chopping block unless you can tie the community activity to these more important business kpis you know your community flywheel needs to work in parallel with your product motion whether it's a sales funnel or whether it's a plg flywheel right you can map those community activities if you understand the buyer's journey from i don't know anything about this product to i'm a raving fan i'm a retained referring user and you can map it the issue becomes a lot of companies don't do multi-touch attribution the technology for multi-touch attribution doesn't exist so then they say oh this person came to my website and and they bought so it must be like seo driving it but nobody knows that that person came to maybe three webinars or attended an in-person event um and and you know what was the dynamic that drove it um and so i think as technology gets better or some way to to figure out how community contributes more tangibly i think there's a technology play there eventually it's yeah it's a it's a great point and the attribution on it is really challenging i think there's ways to simplify it to give you a directional answer even if it's not like the absolute truth but even that's not the easiest thing to do certainly and as a vc i mean we are in the same boat right like for me can i go to um the rest of the partnership and say our community efforts around plg or iran usage-based pricing have generated this many new investments um probably not like there's so many touch points that go into us making investment and a a company choosing openview as a vc uh but there are signals that you can point to that are that um i think are uh indicative of whether whether or not it's having an impact with the target audience you're trying to reach uh and so i i suspect that other folks can get creative with how they measure some of these impacts to prove communities uh the result the community is having definitely you know there's so many ways right a lot of people who say they can't attribute is a cop-out i mean you do a webinar or you do an activity or in-person conference or any any community activity you can see at least the simplest thing is the week of action that happens right you don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out like a day before after a few days before after um and and there are ways to to to track that impact if you look at it from a we did x activities and why people engage with those activities then you can assign points to each of those activities and and multiply there's like different ways you can come up with it the hard part is uh is the offline stuff the brand stuff you can't like you said you know jeff lawson was on this ages ago and he said if you a b test and try to hyper analyze the data on everything every website will become a porn site what he meant by it is sometimes as a founder you need to have a little bit of conviction on what are the things that are good for the business long term that'll drive a customer love and brand and not look at short-term monetary gain because you know sometimes you just need to have that gut right um well i want to just another thing is document the wins right um a lot of times you it's uh maybe anecdotal a sales rep goes i just had a great conversation and so and so said they referred by x and they have been part of the community and webinars xyz uh and so when you have those wins even if they're uh even if the things that you know they're not necessarily quantitative you don't have a b test around it uh being able to point to real stories and real life examples i think uh is something that folks understand and it can resonate with with executives that you can't you know rely 100 on anecdotes but when you get those anecdotes document them and make sure that folks know about them yeah and eventually you get to a point where you know you can institute tools like the testimonial i o testimonial i o or other things where people will share right or partner stack things like that where people will share and you can track the value of the shared ability right eventually if you're really having people come hard on you to say hey do we cut community because i think that's the last thing you cut um if you cut community you kill efforts that could generate maybe one two years down the road and then you get into this immediate motion of i need more sdrs more ease and i need more sort of ad dollars and that's not sustainable long term right yeah absolutely i want to get into you know to close this out what are the different types of community strategies maybe with some tactical examples you had some great you had a great graphic and i can use that in the in the show notes but perhaps dive into into that the different types of community strategies you've seen with some examples well you know first off be active within existing communities uh that's that low hanging fruit everyone wants to start with their own community but um if you're actually a trusted voice where your users are already hanging out you can get more immediate rewards by uh leveraging an audience and an engaged group that already exists so especially if you're for instance a shopify merchant being active within the uh or if you're selling to shopify merchants right or want to be on the shopify app store uh being active within the shopify merchant community is a is a no-brainer the second is uh think about ways that you can connect users with their peers and this is especially relevant if you have a new category or you're targeting a specific persona that's maybe been underserved just have a new approach to the market an example of this that i love is pocus's product led sales community and uh to your point they've actually started with more of a community of product led sales leaders folks thinking about how to do product led sales like what that even means they started with that community before they even had a finished product and they learned from the community how to build a great product and then the third thing is amplifying community creators and so you want to look for those power users those evangelists those people doing innovative things using your product in ways that you hadn't thought of and elevate their voices right so get not just the testimonial or the case study but hey can you take what they've done and turn it into a template or uh showcase their work so that other people can see it and i think an example is notions template gallery they actually even let creator sell templates uh or mir over miro's mural verse community driven template gallery and the final thing is uh content is a kind of naturally i think a great community uh facilitator especially if it's high value like thought leadership uh that people really respond to it and it really helps educate folks about um how to do something and so commun content can be a good kickstarter for a community and build that audience but it has to be really high quality really thoughtful content and that to me is digitalocean strategy is it really started with they treated their content as a product itself uh really made high value content and then have turned that into a much more kind of user generated and community driven um content strategy fantastic if you had to start your community over again what would you do different i probably would have started it sooner uh first of all and i uh i would have uh the biggest thing is starting it sooner and then i think the other thing is uh involve more people that are champions that are really advocating for it find ways to give them much more of an active role uh and do that earlier on fantastic great session kyle it's i mean you're active on linkedin everyone knows you you're a household name in b2b sas and tech but where can people find you yeah folks can find me on linkedin and then i the openview blog or i've got a subsequent newsletter called growth unhinged that i publish once every couple weeks got 10 000 community members on there so be uh be part of that the growth unhinged group awesome we'll share all the links kyle poyer ladies and gentlemen kyle thanks so much for joining us this was fantastic a lot of great community nuggets and gold here for us to build our and scale our communities thank you so much thanks a lot this is fun i need some traction.
