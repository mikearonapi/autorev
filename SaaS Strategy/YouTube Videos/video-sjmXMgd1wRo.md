Hello guys, welcome to another video. In this video, I'm going to show you a tool that I built to help you get organic traffic on autopilot. This tool is called GEO UTC, which stands for generative engine optimized user generated content. So, if you're interested, let's get started. So go to geog.com and click join now to create a free account.

So this tool is currently offered for free. So it's very convenient. Just uh click join now and login using Google. That's it. So after you logged in, you should be able to see a dashboard like that.

So uh it has a left navigation. So it has dashboard. It has a new task which you can click and create a new task by just entering the website you want to analysis. So for example, I want to analysis um Airbnb and then you can put in the airbnb.com and click go. I already did that.

So you can see there's a task in here. And before we create a new task, make sure you also go to settings and enter the website or the platform that you want to connect or you want to post your content to. For example, I wanted to post content to WordPress. So you can go to the first dropdown and select the platform. So currently it supports WordPress, notion and discourse.

So for example, I just want a WordPress. Then click add. You should be able to see a panel like that and add the label and domain URL. For example, I want to post to blog.proactoplay.com and put in the username and app password. So it's not the password for this account, but app password.

You should be able to get it on the WordPress profile page. So after everything's done, click save. So the default post will be on draft but if you want to publish it right away you can check the publish and click save. That should be it. So let's go back to the dashboard.

So after you set up the settings you can go ahead and create a task. So as I mentioned earlier already create one. So let's go to the Airbnb example. So let's click the airb.com and you can see there's a green button here. a green icon here which means this task is scheduled.

So if you do not see the green icon meaning this task is not scheduled. So let's go to airb.com click. As you can see uh after you click this Airbnb or any of the business website you addit you you should be able to see this URL first and then you'll see the analysis results and the first one should be the basic information of this business for Airbnb. You can see that it is a online marketplace for short-term rentals, right? And also brief for this business. You can see the core selling points and also related keywords and also the competitor's information like Booking.com, Verbal, Trip Advisor, Expedia, so on so forth.

So after you verify all the information, you can click next. So you can see uh you can see also the community discussions. So for example the Airb business relevant communities you can see are represented in here. For example there's Airbnb subreddit there's a vacation rental subreddit verbal subreddit. There's a uh travel subreddit so and so forth and also you can see the business brief.

So this is basically a place where you can see your business value. So you can see the title of the business and also the message which you can put on other platforms as showcase what the business does. You can see also the relevant posts. This is very useful. So you can see all these different people are talking about these business related questions like they're talking about a beautiful Vietnam northern part and then basically this is on the subreddit travel.

You got a lot of eyeballs in here. So you can click on this subreddit link or the post link. You'll see the details of this post. So it will directly go to the Reddit uh link. Click this arrow.

You can see uh there's a post description and also you can generate reply. So it's basically air powered reply. You can just click here and then you will generate a reply for this post. So you can copy and paste it and reply to this author. So that's it.

You can choose Chinese uh French uh also like Japanese or Portuguese so on and so forth. After you select the language you want to use to post and then you select platforms.

This is why we need to configure the connectors before you create a task. So for example, we create uh created this WordPress configuration for product deploy right. So we want to post this business article to product deploy WordPress. So you can name it whatever you want but this is example. you want to post it to this location and also you want to figure out what keywords you want to use to generate the article and you can add a keywords.
