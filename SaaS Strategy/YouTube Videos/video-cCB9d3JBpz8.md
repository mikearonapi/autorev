Having scaled and exited
multiple SaaS companies, I have made tons of mistakes as a founder
and I've learned from them over the years. As I've coached hundreds of
founders inside of my coaching programs, I've also helped these founders identify
and navigate the mistakes that they were making in scaling their
companies. In this episode, I'm going to walk you through the
top 10 commonly made mistakes, avoidable mistakes, so that you're able to recognize them
and you're able to move through these challenges faster. And once you understand
what these mistakes are and
you recognize them and you overcome them, you will be able to accelerate your
path to the next stage of growth. Intro.

Now, if you're already part of this community
for part of my coaching programs, my people, welcome back. It's
really awesome to see you over here. When I took ToutApp, my last SaaS
company from zero all the way to exit, I made tons of mistakes. And the reason I started this channel was
to document everything that I learned. I believe that you learn a lot more from
the mistakes than the things that go perfectly well.

Over the years,
as have coached founders, I started to really understand what
are the most common mistakes that other founders make. Overall, I've started to realize that you're
going to make mistakes. It's normal, no one's going to be perfect, but what sets apart the founders that are
ahead of the curve that are successful are the ones that are able to identify
the most common mistakes faster and course correct faster. So in this episode, I'm going to walk you
through the top 10 mistakes, completely avoidable mistakes that
founders keep making when they're scaling their SaaS businesses. Now here's
how I'm going to lay this out.

I'm going to walk you through three
key phases that founders go through. There's the zero to one phase,
the one to 1 million a RR phase, and the 1 million to 3 million a RR phase. For each of these phases, I'm going to walk you through the
top three mistakes I see and all, although at the end if you stick around, I'm going to give you one bonus mistake
that applies to all three phases and really slows founders down. Now
if you're excited to dig in, go ahead and smash that like button
for the YouTube algorithm and let's get right into it. Okay, I'm going to
be following this scaling roadmap.

This is something that I use
with founders that I coach. It helps them understand where they are
in scaling their businesses and helps them figure out what they need to be
focusing on because it can be really overwhelming. As I mentioned, there's the three core stages
that exist for SaaS founders. The first is the zero to one stage,
and for the zero to one stage, what you're really trying to do is get
to product market fit. You're trying to earn that first dollar, and I like to think of it as a benchmark
of at least 10 k of MRR because then you know, okay, there's something
here.

You didn't just get lucky. The second stage is the one to 1
million a RR stage. It's a big band. Companies take all kinds of times to get
there, some get there really quickly, some take years. It all depends on the market you're going
after and the solution that you have and how effective you're
being as a founder.

But the key here is to get to some level
of consistency where you are winning deals and you are starting to
get business on a consistent way, selling the same use case. And
then there's the third stage, which is the scale stage. You get to a million in a RR and now
you're working to get to that 3 million a RR and beyond. Now I'll do a separate
video for what happens between 3 million to 10 million. So if you're
watching and you want me to do that, put 10 million in the
chat and I'll cover that.

But right now we're going
to cover these three stages. I think that's where most of the viewers
are as they're viewing this. Alright, now let's double click on this zero to
one stage. In the zero to one stage, as you're working towards
product market fit, there's some key challenges that
you're really trying to unlock. The first challenge is
what's the target market? Who are you actually going to be serving? The second is what's the actual
problem that you're solving for? Not the idea that you have
but the actual problem.

And then the number three is
what's the value proposition? How do you communicate
what the problem is, who it's for and what your solution does?
That's a one sentence value proposition for this stage where you're
trying to go from zero to one and hit product market fit where people actually
want the product because it solves the problem that they have. These are the
three key challenges you're solving. Now let's dig into what
are the top three mistakes? The first mistake that I see
founders come across in this stage is hiding from customers. I know this sounds completely
counterintuitive because you're like tk, I'm trying to get to revenues,
why would I hide from customers? But the way I see this manifest itself
is founders stay in their comfort zone. They keep saying that, okay,
we're not quite ready yet, but we're going to launch.

Or they try to do all kinds of
scalable marketing activities without talking to a single customer. They're
actually hiding from customers. The thing is, founders are smart and you can rationalize
a lot of things in your head very easily. What I found is it's very easy
to rationalize in your head that you're doing the right things, but in reality you're really hiding from
customers and that's holding you back from getting to the one stage, getting to product market fit because
you're just not getting the data points and there's a very good reason
for why this mistake happens. It is scary to put your baby out there
because as soon as you talk to a hundred people, half of them are going to say no and
the other half may not make a decision right away.

So it's super
scary and you're like, maybe I built the wrong product or
no one wants it and I'm an idiot. So you avoid it. There's the real
human reason why this mistake happens. So that's the number one mistake. The number two mistake I see is
founders tend to focus on the idea instead of the problem.

I meet a lot
of founders that are working to get to product market fit, and I ask them,
what's the problem you're solving? But they'll quickly start to answer what
their idea is or what their technology does or their product does. But
when I push them and I say, Hey, what is the actual problem that your
ideal customer has that you're solving? They struggle with it. They struggle with articulating it and
these kind of stack because they're not talking to enough customers, they can't clearly articulate the
problem the way the ideal customer would. And so they obsess about the idea and
they keep trying to sell the idea. They keep working on the idea instead of
focusing on, well, what's the problem? Because if you can articulate the problem, then it's a lot easier to approach
these people and say, Hey, do you have this problem?
We help you solve it.

And if they're like, it's not really that big of a deal, then you know that you're not going to
hit product market fit because you're not aligned to the right problem. And the third one, again, these stack is because
you're hiding from customers, you're obsessing about your
idea instead of the problem. You keep telling yourself that
you're just one more feature away. I call this the one more feature trap. And so what founders do is they say, you know what? The reason we're not selling is
because we don't have this one feature, and as soon as we add this one
feature, everyone's going to buy.

So let's add this one feature, even though it's going to take eight
months to build or more of a dev team, you name it. And so you go back to your comfort
zone while you're hiding from customers obsessing about your idea, and you're really in the one more feature
trap and you build that feature and you put it out there and then people
still don't buy. So you find another feature that you need to add and then
months go by and you're investing in this product, but no one wants it. So these are the top three mistakes
that I see on the zero to one phase. By the way, if this is resonating, just
so you know I've made these mistakes.

The reason I know these intimately well
is because I've made these mistakes. I've seen founders make these mistakes. Founders come to me and say, tk, it's not working. And so I pull
up the roadmap and I say, cool, where are you in the roadmap?
What's broken? Tell me about it. And then we quickly understand what
the mistake is so we can correct it.

So these mistakes are the common
ones we see over and over. So now let's go to the one
to 1 million a RR stage. This is the stage where your goal is to
get to consistency. And consistency is you're selling a similar use case
to a similar group of customers. If you are selling five different features
to five different groups of people, chances are you're not really going to
get to one millionaire R or it's going to take a very long time.

So what you're really trying to do once
you earn your first set of revenue is what's the use case? What's the group of people and how
do we consistently sell to them? The key challenges that you're working
in this stage is you're trying to figure out what your ideal customer profile is. A lot of times in this stage there are
two or three different ideal customers that you could be going after, but the companies that quickly get to a
million RR really focus on their ICP and they're trying to figure out what that
ICP should be creating. An ICP is not the hard part. The hard part is making the decision on
the right ICP and talking through it or testing and figuring out
which one to double down on. The second one is you're trying to
get to a consistent lead machine.

That's the next challenge. You need to get consistent flow
of leads coming in from that ICP. And the third one is you're trying to
get to a consistent sales or product led machine, meaning out of the leads or
out of their attention you're getting, you're consistently
converting it to real revenue. Those are the big challenges
to get to a million in a RR. Unless you figure those things out, you're
never going to get to a million a RR.

Now, here are the top three mistakes
that I see founders make in this stage. The first one, I see this all the time,
and people rail on me on this channel, they say like, oh my god, tk, you have it against fractional CMOs and
there's a reason for it. It's because I've met so many founders that have
gotten burned by outsourcing go to market, and it's not just fractional CMOs who've
never had a real CMO job. By the way, check their LinkedIn. You'll see I saw fractional CMO that
was pitching one of the founders that I coach.

He had never
even been in marketing. He was a sales guy and not even
a sales guy, a partnerships guy, he had no business
talking about marketing. But the real root of it is founders
are outsourcing the go-to market. They're saying, oh, I'll hire that outbound agency or I'll
hire that marketing demand gen agency, or I'll hire that fractional CMO and that
way I don't have to figure out what my ICP is or what my lead machine
is or what my sales process is. And founders basically make this
mistake over and over one because it's easy, it's easy to just outsource
it and pay some money, but two, it helps you avoid the pain.

It ties back
to the zero to one phase where you're kind of hiding from customers. It's the founders that embrace founder
led go to market in the one to 1 million a R stage. They're the
ones that scale faster. So the first mistake I always see is
outsourcing go to market instead of the founders learning how to do go to market
and getting in front of the customers and getting that machine going. The biggest reason to do this is once
you figure it out and you have the playbook, then you can recruit really great
marketers and salespeople because they're going to meet you and they're
going to say, oh my God, this founder knows their stuff.

I can totally scale this thing. Whereas if you're trying to
outsource and you have nothing, the people that are pitching you or
the people that you're able to hire or able to recruit are the people that no
one else is hiring because they already know they suck. The number two
mistake is premature scaling. Premature scaling is when you think you
have product market fit and you think you have consistency and you're like,
let's burn. Let's hire the 10 reps.

Let's hire the SDRs. Let's spend a
hundred thousand dollars on marketing. It's premature scaling, meaning you're trying to scale before
you really reached consistency. And this is one of the things I always
highlight to founders. They're like, I'm ready to scale.

I'm like,
well, do you have consistency? Because scale comes after consistency, then you scale when you're consistent
with the ICP and the message and the motions. Then you can say, you know
what? These numbers are holding steady. They're continuously winning revenue. Let's now figure out what to double
down on. That's how you scale.

But if you have nothing,
you don't have consistency, it's like you got lucky on a bunch of
deals or you're kind of winning deals, but it's not consistent, then you can't scale. You're trying to get to consistency. So that's the mistake. Number two,
premature scaling. And then number three, I see this all the time and it drives
me nuts is confusing, likes for leads.

This manifests itself in
a couple of ways. One, I see some founders that are like, I'm going to an event and they go to
a bunch of events and everyone's like, oh my god, this is so great. And they love it and they spend
money on these events. They fly, they spend their time. Then they
come back and I'm like, cool, what was the pipeline that came out of
that event and how much revenue came from the last three events you went to? And
the answer is usually not enough or zero.

So they got a bunch of likes, but
not real leads and not real revenue. Events are not the only way. Sometimes I see founders, this is really popular now you hire a
ghost writer and the ghost writer goes on LinkedIn and starts posting every single
day under your account and you start telling these stories. There's a story of how, here's a five things I learned about
enterprise sales when I got engaged. Stories that get a bunch of likes.

You get a bunch of impressions
and people are viewing it, but no leads and there isn't a single
ghostwriter I've met that actually knows how to do LinkedIn. Well, that can commit
to a pipeline number or a lead number. At the end of the day, if you're just
getting a bunch of likes but not leads, you can't afford to do that right
now, if you're a much larger company, if you're a public, CEO, Esh sha, I love
ESH Shah, he's posting all the time. He can do that because he has an
entire army of marketers on the backend collecting leads. He can do the brand marketing.

But if you're just starting out,
you can't afford to just get likes. You need leads. So you need to be thinking about the
difference between the likes and the leads and what you need to be focusing on that
will actually generate leads for you. So that's a top mistake that I see. Now before I go to the third stage
and before I go to the bonus one, that applies across all stages
and really slows down founders.

Let me pause here for a second. Are
you starting to see the power in this? There's three things I want
to highlight here. One, everyone's going to make mistakes. No matter how perfect you are, you're going to make mistakes. What sets apart the founders that win
versus the ones that die from these mistakes are they're able to recognize
the mistakes and they're able to course correct faster.

They're able to
go through the mistakes faster. That's the first thing. The second
thing is this happens over and over, so don't beat yourself up over it. The only thing that matters is if you
take the next step to correct these mistakes. And the third thing is
the YouTube algorithm just
absolutely loves it when you smash that like button.

So
if you are enjoying this, if you're getting value from this,
if you're getting jazzed by this, going to smash that like button
for the YouTube algorithm, it loves it when you do that. Also, in all seriousness, these mistakes are near and dear to my
heart because it truly breaks my heart when I see founder showing
up every day working so hard, having taken so much risk, but they're still stuck on these common
mistakes and that's why I wanted to create this video. So if
you are getting value, also give me a yes in the comments below. Also, if you're in this phase where you're
looking to drive growth for your SaaS business and you want to reduce
what I call the execution risk, you want to avoid these mistakes, you want to get through these mistakes
faster and you want my coaching so I can guide you in this path. Be sure to check out my SaaS
go-to-market coaching program.

You don't have to go anywhere right now. I'll tell you more about it
at the end of this episode. Let's go to the next phase and let's
talk about the bonus mistake as well. The third phase, this is
where you get to a million. Now only 4% of companies
get to a million in arr, which is a wild statistic, but
only 0.04% ever get to 10 million, meaning the mortality rate is horrible
even after you get to a million.

So a lot of founders get to a million
and then lose it all either through churn or because they screw up that next stage
of growth. The goal of the million to 3 million, this is the slice that
I really like to focus on. Now, if you're past 3 million and you're
looking to get to 10 million, 20 million, put 10 million in the comments below and
I'll do an episode just on that phase as well. But this million to 3 million
is where you truly start to scale. And the key challenges that
you're looking to unlock is one, you're really trying to make sure
you can keep your consistency.

A lot of times I'll meet
founders, it got to a million, but it's three different ICPs, and
now in order to get to 3 million, you can't afford to do that anywhere. You really got to figure out where
you're going to be consistent. The second challenge that you're trying
to unlock is who do I need versus what do I need to do? You got to a million because you got
great at figuring out all these pieces you did. The founder led go to market, you
didn't outsource it. But ironically, once you get to a million
looking to get to 3 million, you have to start thinking
about who do I need on the team? Who do I need help from? Who
do I need as support as advice, or to do the things versus what
do I need to do? It's a shift.

And the third one is you need to
think about your unit economics. When you're scaling, it's
very easy to burn money. So you really have to think about is this
actually net profitable just even on a customer basis or on a channel basis? Maybe not on an overall
basis if you're VC act, but at least you have to think
about the unit economics, otherwise you won't be able to
raise your series A. Okay. Now, the top three mistakes in
this stage, number one, you chase the new versus doubling down.

I see this all the time. Founders got to a million because they
kept making the product better and better based on the customer feedback. So when
they get to a million, they're like, we've got to get to 3 million. Oh my God, we've got to unlock these three
new areas of product. The thing is, what happens more often in getting
from a million to 3 million is not necessarily way new product
features or multiple products, but it's to strengthen the parts of your
product that customers already lock to go deeper in the use case.

So a lot of times founders get distracted
chasing the new because that's what got them to a million instead of
doubling down, and that's a huge mistake. The second is, this is nuanced. It's one of two things. It's either losing focus or
too rigid on the old playbook, and it depends from company to company. And this is where we try to figure out, okay, what is the scenario here?
Sometimes you're losing focus, all the stuff that got you to a million,
you stop doing, you discount it.

You don't realize that's the
discipline that got you here. And so you start to slow down. The other thing that happens on the other
end is you stay so rigid on that thing that you did to get to a million, you don't realize that that's not
going to get you to 3 million. And this is one of those nuanced
mistakes where it depends. That's where this gets you.

That's where you need that outside
perspective because it could be the case you're losing focus or it could be the
case you're too rigid on the old playbook and you're going to stay stuck or start
going backwards and you need to figure out that mistake happens quite a bit. And then the third one, I borrowed this one from the godfather
of SaaS. I've also lived this. That's why I know it very
well and I'm sensitive to it, is hiring desperation execs. I've
seen founders do this.

They realize, you know what? I got to get some people
on and they're at 1,000,005. Actually, I've seen this at 5 million. And the founders are a little tired
and they're so desperate to get help. They're so desperate to get
help. They hire a desperate exec.

And this manifests in a couple of ways. The first way is they don't
know what good looks like. I was talking to a founder and they're
like, I need to hire a VP of sales. I'm like, cool, how are you
thinking about the role? What does the job description look like? Are you going to hire a recruiting agency? Are you going to do it on your own? And
they're like, I got a guy. And I'm like, okay, let's take a look at the guy.

And
I look at the LinkedIn and I'm like, oh my God. And this is one of those things where
it's interesting because coaching is not about telling you what to do. Coaching
is helping you get to the answer. So I was like, let me ask you this. Do you have a reference blueprint? Do you know three VPs of sales that you
just absolutely love that crushed it, they're the best of the best? And he
looked at me puzzled and he was like, no, not exactly.

And I'm like, that's right. So how can you possibly hire a really
great exec or recruit a really great exec if you don't know what good looks like? So let's first look at some LinkedIn
profiles of great VPs of sales, and let's talk through how they got to
a great VP of sales and what a history looks like. So sometimes this
manifest is as founders are hiring, they're switching to who do I need versus
what do I need to do right thing to do. But they don't know
what great looks like. They don't know what a
great executive looks like.

Other times founders are maybe a little
bit in the earlier stage or they're not spending the money on the recruiting
or they don't know how to recruit. So they hire the first exec that comes
and they're so desperate to have someone own this. They just hand over the reins. I've seen this in a VP of sales hire. I've seen this in A COO hire.

I was horrified when I met one of the
COO candidates that one of the founders that I was coaching hired. I
was like, oh my God, I see this. Because he was just tired. He just needed
help. He was like, I don't know, tk, I just need to get this guy on.

He's going to help me. And I'm like, is it worth it? How tired are you? Is it actually worth it for you
to hire the desperation exec? And I can't call him the desperation
exec. We can have that conversation. So that's how it manifests itself. You just don't know what great looks like
and you got to figure that out before you hire or you're so
tired, you'll take anybody.

And you really need to think about, are
we better off promoting from within? Are we better off grunting
it off for three more months? Are we better off for me to take a short
break and then coming back and making this decision versus
doing a desperation exec? So that's the third
mistake that I see. Okay, so those are the nine mistakes that I
promised you and I did promise you a bonus once. If you're still watching, hopefully
you're getting value. If you are, please smash that like button
for the YouTube algorithm. The bonus mistake that I see
across all the stages is founders don't do the math, not doing the math.

And this is specific to what's
near and dear to my heart, which is these stages are about revenue. It's not doing the math on what it takes
to get a certain amount of revenue. The rule of thumb is you need
five x of your revenue target for pipeline. What that means is if you want to
generate another 2 million of revenue, you're at a million ARR and now
you want to get to 3 million. That means that you got to keep
all of your existing revenue, keep the 1 million.

So you need
a proper customer success system. And then on top of that, you need 2 million of net new revenue. The rule of thumb, this is where a lot of
founders make this mistake, and I'll explain why it applies
even on the zero to one phase, but let's talk about the scale space
since we're there to get to 3 million in order to get 2 million net new revenue. The rule of thumb is you need $10 million. You need $10 million of pipeline
five x of your net new revenue target.

Why? Because certain number of leads will
turn into pipeline and you'll only win a certain number of deals. You're not
batting a hundred percent, no one is. So the rule of thumb, if you were to bring in a VP of sales
and a VP of marketing and a board member, they're like, cool, we got a
five x your revenue target. You need that much pipeline. Or
what are we going to do for that? A lot of times founders don't realize
just how much pipeline or attention if you will, is needed to hit certain revenue numbers.

This is true even for getting to a million in error. If you want to get a million in net
new business times that by five, you need $5 million of pipeline. If
you're trying to go from zero to one, this math still applies. In
order to get one new customer, you need to be talking to
at least a hundred people. You'll get one customer once
you talk to a hundred people, unless you have absolutely
no product market fit.

And a lot of times this is a
mistake that founders make. They don't know to do the math, and I
don't say this again from a soapbox. I'm saying this, I've made this mistake. Those are the big mistakes that I
wanted to share with you today. Now, let's quickly recap.

So to recap, as
you are scaling your SaaS business, these are the three key stages you go
through. You go to the zero to one stage, and then that's really to try
to get to product market fit. Then you're working to get to
the one to 1 million a R stage. And then once you get to 1 million
a RR, that's your consistency stage, and then you're working to get
to a million to 3 million a r. That's your scale stage.

And then
once you hit a 3 million a r, there's a whole new set of challenges
that come up for that stage. But I wanted to cover these three stages. And as you're going through these stages, there are unique challenges that come
up that you have to unlock to get to the next level. But more importantly, there's
these mistakes that keep coming up. So in this video, I wanted to show you the top 10 mistakes
that I keep seeing over and over and over that I've made.

And my intention
here is to make you aware of these mistakes so that you can recognize
it. And once you recognize it, then you're like, okay, cool. What do we need to do to push
ahead to get to the next level? Now that I recognize it, that way, you don't lose months stuck in a mistake
and you don't waste months or lose months because you're making one
of these mistakes in a big way. Some of these mistakes are fatal if
you don't recognize 'em fast enough. But all of these mistakes are
a hundred percent avoidable.

Once you know about them, then you'll
recognize and you're like, okay, cool. Here's what we need to do. So now you know the top 10 mistakes
that I see over and over. Now, what you may not know is tk, I
kind of know what stage I'm in. I know what I need to unlock.

I'm making some of these mistakes. How do I break through? So if you want to work with me to
drive growth for your SaaS business, this is why I created my SaaS
go-to-market coaching program. Inside of this program, I help you go from your
current go-to-market strategy
to a well-defined and scalable go-to-market strategy
that you can execute on, so you can get to that next stage
of growth. Inside of the program, we focus on three core pillars. The first
pillar is your ideal customer profile.

Regardless of what stage you're in, you really need to figure out who you're
targeting and who's more likely to buy. The second is your manifesto. This is
your messaging. This is your positioning. This is how you go out there and get
attention in the world so that people pay attention to you, become leads, become pipeline so you can put them
through your process.

Once you have these two pieces, you have your go-to-market
strategy. Then comes the third pillar. That's the Broadway show. The Broadway show is a consistent set of
sales and marketing activities that you can run to bring your manifesto
to your ICP on a consistent basis. Now, depending on the stage you're in, your Broadway show is going
to be different.

If you're
in the zero to one stage, you have a certain kind of Broadway
show that you're going to have to own. If you're in the one to million stage, well then you can start to
get a little bit of leverage, but you'll own the overall piece. If
you're at the million to 3 million, well, very quickly it starts to
become a question of who do
we need and how do we get leverage? And I guide you
through all of these pieces. So if you'd like to work together
inside of the Go-to-Market program, just go to tk.com/gtm tkk.com/gtm. Over there, you'll see this page.

It'll give you all the details about
the program and how it works. Now, the one thing that I know is the
better the fit, the better the results. So if you'd like to work together, all I ask is you book a short
call with me on the call. We'll figure out where you are in the
business, what you're struggling with, and what you need to do to get
to that next stage of growth. And if it sounds like it's
a fit and I can help you, we'll be off to the races right away.

So just go to tkk to.com/gtm. Now,
if you got value from this video, please smash that like button
for the YouTube algorithm. It just loves it when
you do that. Now also, I drop an episode every single Sunday
with actionable strategies and tactics from the trenches on how to grow your
SaaS business faster. So if you haven't already, be sure to hit that
subscribe button and that bail icon.

You'll get notified every single
time I drop an episode. Also, if you have a fellow
founder, a team member, if part of a Slack group or
WhatsApp group with other founders, please share this video with them. It just means the world to us. We put a lot of love into these
videos. And lastly, remember, everyone needs a strategy for
their life and their business.

When you are with us, yours,
it's going to be unstoppable. I'm tk and I'll see you inside the
SaaS Go-to-market coaching program. Take care, everybody. What is the third thing? Oh, every single
Saturday. That's not true.
