## Transcript

those early days people come back if you've researched you've had a good connection with them and got to know them and they believe in what you're trying to do going back to them keeping a register of those people you've spoken with I do in terms of research but their name the company their email address and going back to the first a task that takes 30 minutes for example and could you get it done in a couple of minutes like one or two minutes or less don't try to go hey we're going to try and revolutionize the way people order their food or something like that which is still great but in terms of micros sess what can we do in our day-to-day work or in our even personal lives things that take half an hour or so how can we really nail that down what's that repetitive structure that's frustrating that we could close that Gap really easily those 6 to 12 18 months is spent understanding the market whether your product or developer marketing or sales or whatever that is so I think ideally being from the area and saying the users if you are a user that's even better if you're someone who uses it a lot or someone who's had that time point it's a good place to start if you don't have that person research the crap out of it it was up to maybe three or four meetings a week I reach out to people for 20 minutes for some research to pick their brains about a couple Concepts or try diagnose their jobs to be done or just really get as much information as I can CU yeah there are definitely is confirmation bias for your own [Music] ideas today's episode we're going to talk about micras more specifically how to build launch and scale a successful micro SAS my guest today is Alex kohart Alex started his career in sales moved later to go to market head of marketing and is now advising companies on their product marketing he does this with a company called Market science next to this he's also a mentor on grp mentor and he shares a lot of content on LinkedIn and substack about size product marketing goto market and everything else related to startups welcome to the show Alex thanks so much Jordan great to be here man feel very privileged let's just Dive Right In so we're going to talk about micras how to build launch and skill one but let's start with this super Basics what is actually a micro size probably the the simplest version is just in the name it's a simple version of software as a service so subscription based servicing the way I like to frame it is we think about basic functionality one user one paino one solution one um Persona instead of using a SAS in terms of Enterprise level it could be B Toc or sort of marketplaces I want to think about micro SAS a lot of them are B2B versions of it but basically very small scale SAS single point Solutions and typically um a differentiator is run by one person you hear about these people called Indie hackers or Freelancers that can build on their own so single team micro that can be run by one or even a part-time person so one user one Persona one solution one person actually building it it's keeping it small yeah I think that's my personal definition I'm sure there other micras experts out there but my personal definitions single use case single Persona single paino I'm sure we'll get to in a bit but there's some examples i' argue potentially calendly back in the day was a single use case single paino that that they solve there's other ones out there from I think chat PDF is now a big one as well so you can upload a PDF ask it questions using AI the Hemingway app I don't know if you ever used that before that's a pretty handy app helps you simplify your words your text it's just one page is a whole app so very simple but plugs are usually a common but like painful point that people just go want this little thing taken care of yeah why should people consider building a micro size I think we'll cave it again there are some people I've met who are micro sass veterans by no means is it the easy option I said any I think all all startups and all founders have their own Journey but I think for micras I love it personally and I advocate for it and I think originally I did a post about this on LinkedIn and it got some attention off the back of it is that it forces you to do best practice so I said before single use case single problem be very specific with the problem test it find a sort of if if you get buil an allinone or those old coin phrases when it comes to products if you can't really na okay what are you doing this for who are you trying to help in what way and it also forces you to start with a niche we always talk about nailing a nichan startups we always talk about finding a paino finding a specific user and a specific Channel I think the idea with micro is that you're forced to do it so I think number one is definitely force you to do best practice you can't really develop the crap out of something and hope it works the other one is positioning and product messaging I think one one of the biggest issues in B2B SAS today is people struggle to articulate what they do there's a lot of really great experts coming out at the moment but being able to say if you're say that calendly example or chat sort of PDF it's pretty easy to frame what you do you can explain the functionality of it I help do this you upload a PDF you can ask questions really simple people get it if you have the problem it's Rings pretty true I think for the perceived effort of customers that's another one as well like now more and more we've got I think in the last couple years increasing by 20 or 20 30% every year of the number of SAS applications we use as professionals is growing so I think there's resistance to change people are just flooded with it they don't want to adopt a new product they don't want to spend more budget but something smaller cheaper easier single use case that you can basically get value out of almost immediately I think that's another bonus low objections to pricing as well as is another pretty important one you've got a few were to sell which I've done in the past sold sort of Enterprise level SAS you're talking about multiple stakeholders multiple value props timelines you've got huge hopes to jump through for security and procurement but if you look at the simple plugin ideally with the credit card payment get started quickly less objections less friction people more open to it as an example I always use adify and if you ever heard of adify before they're doing really well so I use those guys and I pretty much purchase it on the spot they basically do a plugin for YouTube videos that they give you summaries of it or the transcript or just doop points it saves me so much time when I want to watch an hour webinar instead I'll just jump on that click a button and it'll give me the quick breakdown to see if that's sort of of of interest to me um that's $33.99 a month just buy it straight away they've got 500,000 users 2 million AR right then and there for a pretty standard tool low running cost is the other one there's less of a need to go and get investment you haven't got to build a really complicated Dev team or a product team and go through it a lot of these guys are really talented but they can build a heap of these micro sasses just off off the back of I know a couple of them who do it parttime on top of their fulltime job as well simpler running costs lower prices lower expectations as well you sell $2,000 a month SAS product that comes with expectations for support what you get out of it if people don't get what they want they put up a fight but smaller ones it's yeah do and you do this one problem I you to fix if you can fix it great I'm not going to go down the rabbit hole on it but I'm also not going to expect a half hour meeting with your support team that's probably the four or five main ones my favorite one being that simplified messaging simplified go to market and also the less need for investors not ragging on any investors out there but I think too early on sometimes that investment can sway the vision of the product as well and you get more freedom it's easy to bootstrap and you can steer it in any way you want seen some of these micro sasses start with this Niche or simple process and and then build out from that and create more and eventually turn into a decent size SAS product if they wish to go down that that path in the early days it's very simple small bar entry and gets the customers in Faster nice I think that's a really good reasons why to start and I guess the question followup question I would have here like simple doesn't always mean easier right because a simplified go-to Market sometimes it's even harder to really nail down your go-to Market if you want to make it super simplified so I guess to turn into my next question like what skills or knowledge do you think are needed to actually succeed in a micro Sask things are going to be simple and simplified and smaller but you have to do everything probably yourself as well so what do you actually need to be successful that's a good question I'd say I think similar to that whole and I hate the phrase founder mode but it's that grit and the ability to I don't think with any product we can build it and hope for the best having the ability to go out there a lot particularly in the early days and learn a lot what the process is because I think the catches as well as much as a low barrier is fantastic and get to the market a bit faster get some users validate your product the bad part of having a low barrier as we all know is people can come in easy but they can leave easy so if we're not really justifying a a niche spot day-to-day Workforce it can lower that and people can leave quite quickly so I think the skills do micras just old school tenaciousness there there's some really good ex marketers or sales people who are willing to just go out there cold call or cold email meet people and try and validate the product I think having the ability to Pivot quickly is another one as well so I guess if you make it for argument sake an emailing tool and you go out there and some people like it some people don't it's not hitting the mark you've got the room to build on top of it you can still iterate and grow a product and refine it but with micras the beauty of it being small simple cheap is that if you pivot too much you pretty much got to start again in a way and I know I'm doing run right now with a partner of mine and he's got I think we've done maybe two or three pivots so far very basic MVPs but we try to validate as much as we can we ask as many people as we can we keep it super lean and then we go yeah this is not really feeling like someone find it interesting but people aren't necessarily wanting to pay for it so maybe we got to think about this problem again so I think having a decent level of understanding of product L growth or that's a very broad statement but in terms of understanding UI ux product marketing and and sort of the ability to Market and sell and and and on board and get people active on a product that doesn't need a lot of handholding in saying that like all startups the first days you've got to be quite manual you've got to get people up and running you've got to get your hands dirty but over time I take that aify company for an example if you're charging $4 um a month and you look at return period of six months you're looking at $24 right you've got to try to figure out a way to find them get them on board activate them keep and keep them retained some plg best practices how do you engage with the market are there certain things like growth loops and for those who know the sort of grow Loops being when people send you an invite it says powered by C Le for the premium tier you can use it helps build that traction or helps build more people to come to your platform so I'd say being very good with uiux being very good with product Le growth and being able to Pivot very quickly being able to move to another idea in the early days at least so don't be marri to your idea because if these simple smaller Solutions the beauty of them are is that they're simple and they're small and if we over complicate and build on top of it um you got to be willing to burn some stuff some days yeah yeah and I think this is a good example of simple doesn't always mean easy in this case you you need to be able to do a lot of things quickly validate your ID being able to sell be good with UI ux like that growth you will need to be able to do a lot of things to build a micras we're going to break it down we're going to talk about build large and skill let's start with the first question how can somebody if they're convinced they want to build a micras can you walk us through the process of identifying maybe a KNE Market or specific pain point when they want to build like a m micras I'm always a big advocate of Founders creating products from Industries they're familiar with or at least have a lot of exposure to it's like the number one thing with new products is learning all the nuances if you go to a new company or a new industry you're not familiar with the first six to 12 18 months is spent understanding the market whether your product or developer or marketing or sales whatever that is so I think ideally being from the area understanding the users if you are a user that's even better if you're someone who uses it a lot or someone who's had that pain Point that's a good place to start if you don't have that person research the crap out of it it was up to maybe three or four meetings a week I reach out to people for 20 minutes for some research to pick their brains about a couple of Concepts or try diagnose their jobs to be done or just really get as much information as I can because yeah there definitely is confirmation bias for your own ideas and there's no perfect linear path to this but these are ideas that I I consider my partner who's a developer who's helped me on this he always says think about a task that takes 30 minutes for example and could you get it done in a couple of minutes like one or two minutes or less don't try to go hey we're going to try and revolutionize the way people order their food or something like that which is still great but in terms of micro assess what can we do in our day-to-day work or in our even personal lives things that take half an hour or so how can we really nail that down what's that repetitive structure that's really frustrating that we could close that Gap really easily with and that being saying before about aify and I like their version of summarizing the transcript really quickly you can export the transcript put it in chat gbt and do those things as well but they cut those steps down for that as well so I think thinking of processes in your work or different areas see if you can cut that down to ideally a minute the other one I think's really good is that it's a blessing and a curse the SAS industry right now is I hate to keep saying flooded but it is just full of products there is a product for everything and now I feel these products are getting better so there's just so much going on and that some of the bigger players The Hub spots and the sales forces and the the male chimps those guys so big and they start growing laterally soon I think that's s the other day Notions getting into email now I think maale chimp is now almost a full CRM like they get bigger and bigger whilst growing as this Behemoth The the opportunity is I think that sometimes within their Suite of tools is usually something they're not doing very well or something that there could be even missing and something I I like to do is you go through like product pages Capa Source Forge all these different areas and you try to find the the ratings of the products that get like one star and if someone's I hate this part of this product or Salesforce annoys me that it it doesn't do this thing and finding those gaps I think within the larger more established platforms out there and going can I do it better and the third part to that would be is there parts of it that people say someone wants to um buy HubSpot but they only want to use it for this one piece of it and it's maybe instead of a pipeline maybe that's all they want in a system and they just want to automate the pipeline is there a system out there I know pipe drive and there's some other ones out there can you break that down into a symbol of use case of it like who was it same with their BCC email the BCC email that tracks all the emails and and lodges it to the profiles of the people so if there's something small and that you just want to pull out and go I'm just going to use that piece I don't need to have the full Suite of the CRM I just want to take this one recording piece and if someone's willing to pay for that but like I was saying that comes back down to you can't get away from it best practices for going to Market who's the product for what do they want to use it are they willing to pay for it and what pain is it going to solve so I think those are a few areas that I look at and really try to think I think one one one of the best ones is what something in your day-to-day work or your team's day day-to-day work that takes 20 30 minutes or an hour that is repetitive I ideally on a monthly basis that you could cut down for a couple of clicks of a button easier said than done but I definitely see some amazing work out there yeah yeah and I think if it's something you experience yourself you're going to have a lot more passion with it rather than you're going to find something by either researching or or checking the re or negative reviews which is a really good one still you won't be as passionate probably as you experienced the problem yourself and you're basically going to f fix your own problem 100% I think on on the last point if you're familiar with the problem the old saying if there's no product for this then why sometimes there's a good reason like sometimes people have tried and failed pretty hard on it so if you're in the industry go I I realize now why no one's done this or I don't know why no one's done this so yeah I completely agree yeah and that's where the resarch comes into place check if somebody actually try to do it already before you yes let's say things work out or things look good research looks good we're going to build an MVP what kind of steps do you recommend for building the MVP so the minimum viable product and how do you how would you test it viability so we already talked about making sure it has a paino right but how do we make sure that you can go further with it yeah but I think there's a lot of crossover to standard sort of MVPs building the base use cases of it the one I do now is I do a really standard product marketing go to market pitch deck just a pain in the use case and a couple of concept images of what I see it working and out workking and the beauty of sort of micros that's really simple doesn't have to be 15 pages and different dashboards hopefully just a really small version of it I think testing that and and I'll call these meetings and I'll ask people go through their jobs to be done and what are they doing here what are their pain points what do they love what do they need and I'll show them the product at the end and be like this is what I'm thinking and that version of it has saved me a lot of time and money of people getting to there and going this was cool and I think I had six meetings and by the six1 that just said this is cool love the idea I get it I'd probably use it but I wouldn't pay for it and I'm like okay good to know there back to the drawing board on that and thank God we didn't put any code into this I think that one there of going to those areas I think the simple pitch deck it's not perfect but at least if I'm talking to people who are have a full-time job and they're exploring a as you said a micro sass or playing with the idea I'm the biggest advocate of crawl walk then run don't build anything quickly don't try to scale it too quickly get the foundation blocks uh done first and I think spending the time like I know one of the ideas we did it was a very basic sort of website and it was um really bare minimum data we put in the back and I could probably share it but it was the idea of people commenting a lot I know people on LinkedIn a lot they're forced to inter with posts the sort of algorithm forces you to interact before it rewards you there's a lot of flooding of AI comments and I'm sure you've seen them out there there's the same generic comment that's said under each thing and I was like surely there's a faster way to do it not all AI because that's not working but what if instead if you written say 100 blog posts or yourself on this podcast and what if it could read your existing content and I'm sure there's nuggets of gold in there that you could pull out and give yourself a quote of hey here is an idea to add to this to this post here's something I can add we drum a very B basic version of it we tested a couple times some good some bad but when I say MVP this thing was very basic it was just enough for me cuz I was probably one of the users I could test it and have a bit of a play with it so I would say there's probably no different advice from normal SAS don't rush into it don't build too quickly validate the crap out of it and wait until you hear the same response over and over again refine my pitch eventually if I keep hearing the same feedback ideal good feedback I go okay there's something here I spoke to about you before we started this this podcast about another idea I have and and you shared a very similar sentiment that probably last couple people have spoken to as well I find that very interesting there something with a clear pattern there want to learn how expandi made over 100k in a year by having other people recommending them by simply listing their affiliate program in the Rus Marketplace they receive new affiliate requests which turned into traffic which turned into recurring Revenue want to learn more go to get ready.com I like that the idea of bring building a pitch deck before even writing a line of code validate your ID and if people are not willing to pay for it then at least you don't have to spend a lot of money and effort and time into into building something but let's say ID is validated so we're going to go to the launch phase so we now build a super early MVP of the micro how do we generate first leads attract first-time users for a product which is super simplistic right yeah for sure I think in the like I was going this might go against my sentiments before but I think yeah definitely knowing the plg side of things if you're an SEO expert or know someone there or you've got a certain area you think you can slot yourself into that but I think Bare Bones right at the beginning I just have never worked anywhere that you can get away from it but got old fashion outbound within reason don't spam your Market but being able to reach out to people crawl walk run if you've ideally done the previous steps you should know your positioning you should know your messaging of what you need to say the pain Point you're going to validate I think something that is really handy is those research stages it's funny right when I say to someone hey can I show you my product maybe not but if I say I've got this idea that I'm building an MVP for I'd love to get your feedback or I'd love to see what you think then all of a sudden there's substantially more acceptance rates and people yeah I'd love to check it out and it's ironic because it's somewhat of a bit of a sales pitch anyway you're just explaining your idea and if it rings true to them they'll then they'll come back to it so I'd say a lot of the times I've done that in these early days people come back if you've researched you've had a good connection with them and got to know them and they believe and what you're trying to do going back to them keeping a register of those people you've spoken with I do in terms of research but their name the company their email address and going back to them first and I know there's companies called like score app I don't know if you heard of score app before they do some pretty cool stuff in terms of waiting pages so they'll do one's like sign up for your expression of interest and they'll say here's this idea we're building it's coming soon it'll ask you some questions it'll say what's your main use case for this what's your paying point for this how much would you pay for this and it's a qualifier but if you can get enough people to go through that sort of fill that out and go hey I've got a little database now as I release this and if you're feeling up for it you can do the whole building public send them updates of what you're doing but I think that research section of finding those first customers is a pretty solid area because they probably built rapport with them they probably know what you're on about and they're probably more willing to try it first so I think launching that first finding your first couple the first one is saying do some outbound being comfortable with outbound I know some people aren't but I think having the ability that if you have built something that you love and you do know who you're targeting it it's so much easier than just Mass spamming your market so I think going after in those ones but I think long term ideally I'm a big fan of building your own person personal brand and I know for some people it's like pulling teeth it's it's a lot of effort and it's not an immediate payoff but I've worked with many Founders who take the time to join communities or join Discord groups or LinkedIn groups or even just local communities or trying to think of any other ones even just like local meetups like people in person or conferences and I think getting into that industry depending on what you're doing and being renowned more and more that helps people build a following for you if you start talking about it or build in public you get some some people coming through there's something called The Lean Marketing funnel is is what I call it and pretty much that's for example if I was to build a Content creation tool as a microsof tool and I did a uh webinar about the best practices or I shared my research or I found hey here is what the top 50 content creators deal with their three biggest problems or something like that and I did say a webinar going to different Community groups so if there's like a as I said a Discord group or LinkedIn group or just a local community or a slack group of people that gather and they talk about content marketing then offering and saying hey I can give a free webinar about this you share your insights I try to keep it 98% not selling 2% promotion at the end of it but just going there and saying hey this is what I'm doing speak about your journey I've interviewed 50 people I found that everyone has the same Niche problem what I'm seeing is that I feel the industry is going in this direction here are some quotes I've received people for for the most part like to hear that stuff like they like to hear oh cool what' you find out or what are the issues there and if I'm a content creator like what other people saying that I'm I'm not aware of of and then at the end all this research and what I did create this product about to launch if anyone's Keen feel free to have a crack at it or if it's an association if you're a member here you get 5% off or or whatever that is but basically tapping into communities that already exist and leading with value first I think that is probably the most valuable thing and it's probably the least costly version of it less invasive and it definitely adds to your brand too so if you cement yourself as this person expert in this area it's really valuable long term and they'll probably start following you on your substack or LinkedIn as well so I appr say those three number one don't get away from your outbound number two be more involved with communities or three just try to share knowledge in a way to promote what you do yeah and these two the last two I really like as in lead with value and join webinars join podcasts share your knowledge and then at one point people are going to find out like hey what does Alex actually do or what does Juran actually do and they're going to check out your product or join your newslet and then at one point it starts compounding over time so you just build up this audience the same way you mentioned with the waiting list build up an audience you own which then you can follow up with if you have your new microsof or you actually have an MVP ready 100% yes and if you've done it if you're passionate about it and you're from that industry I think people respect that and you've got a big idea I think people love to follow great ideas so I think just sharing it and getting amongst it it's so surprising you can pitch them and you can email them and you run ads on them but just sharing your passion and showing something and helping them Bo has a far better outcome yeah and I think these are really nice ways of of marketing right so this is probably the launching phase itself it sounds easy because we just discussed it a couple of minutes but this does take quite a bit of time if we go one step further I gave examples at the beginning of the podcast where company went from micro size to more normal size if we look at microsof how is the scaling part different than scaling a normal size yeah I'd say probably the point before about being very cognizant of your margins and your sort of plg side of thing So eventually when it comes to scaling it you got to have your sort of processes done you got to be able to both both technically and with within the market as well having the ability to take on more customers sticking to that but I guess the again back to that barrier of entry point the blessing in the curse is easy in and easy out so if you do see success if you've used very low Tech tools and you've built it over three hours or something like that not saying that's much hard to do you can get fast followers as well so I think that's a massive risk that's really worth thinking about I think the idea of micro the long-term vision of say if you were to if you take hubs what find a piece they're not doing you go do it really well and then go back to them I think that's a really cool Exit Plan as well like you know where it fits in and you can probably resell it back to them it is a good proposition back to the people that could slot it into their stack so I think for scaling being very cognizant that you will have fast followers and if it is very easy to spin up and low barrier entry then you will get people coming after you pretty quick but I think yeah paying attention on the positive side paying attention to your sort of plg having enough analytics to really look at your customer Journey let say if if a lot of it is you know um SEO or or referral or if you're looking at affiliate marketing for example you've got a lot of people coming in for low sales touch experience because that's ideally micros you can't really sustain a large sales team for for most Parts having the ability to track those sort of metrics across there where are they coming from where are the bottlenecks getting stuck at what point is are they getting activated simp like basic SAS best best practice because a lot of micros SAS by Nature will probably be a lot of plg nailing that quickly keeping really in tune with your uiux so not if you get to a certain point you've got to start interjecting with support services or sales Services you down the wrong line but I think looking into growth loops and again that's another saying sounds good different in practice but I think exploring those different areas and and I'll use that example again from cly where they you share the link and it prompts the person receiving the link if they'd like to join as well looking at those ones there as far as scaling it um is going to be your most cost effective version of it I know there's things mirror as well I think if you're brainstorming on a board you invite someone in it prompts them to be to sign up for their own there's a bunch of different areas so I think I'm always a big fan of low cost if you can prove something low cost it's got the right fit you know if you can prove something organically it works and then if you can build it out from there but I'd say scaling as cheap as possible your plg best practice your your growth Loops if maybe as a costing you'd probably look at more MLG so marketing Le growth looking at ads and hopefully by this point you've already done your research for first you've launched with your first customers you should know very clearly type of buyers why they buy and what they use it for at that point I think so much marketing doesn't work because people don't do those first stages I'm hoping that microsof forces people to at least nail that really well so have the ability to have hey I know the three types of people that buy it I know exactly what they look like I know like what they want it for and how they want it running ads with that as their product marketing messaging behind that should have a higher effect so social ads or promotions or any of those areas let's say the growth Loops obviously looking through SE your SEO plgs and there's other ones I've seen do quite well as supplementary to Services it's probably been the other way around there've been a Services business that adds in the micros and that way they're not really weighed down and forcing this thing to be hugely success with thousands of users it can grow on the side as well depending on the type of business you want to use it for if you're a consultant and you're just using this as a supplementary bit of income great but if you've got a scale it to 10 grand a month 200 Grand a month or whatever that is you got to really think about the lowc cost versions of bringing those customers in yeah and this is going to tie really well into my next question as in people start this because they want to have a lifestyle business or at least they want to replace their income with a micro right you're doing it somewhat yourself as well you have an agency but you're also thinking about building your own micras because you probably want to have something on the side which is also going to drive revenue for you which is not always reliant on your time MH you gave a lot of advice already so keep your margin order make sure you have your cost in order make sure you have the the grow Loop working the product like grow Motion in place like are any other strategies or maybe advice you would have for people who want to go from a side project or an MVP to an actual sustainable income resource I'd say similar to that one before around the testing I know there's another really handy one another very successful micras developer who said originally like when you're testing that sort of do you want things paid for try to do something managing on the side research is prettyy flexible in your own time if you look at terms of doing PC's I know this somewhat goes against my whole plg stance but in those early stages finding someone who believes in what you're doing who gets it who has the pain point and I've seen ones go hey we're not sure about this we think this is the right area doing a three-month proof of concept I've seen a lot of people do this and work really well saying hey we're just going to start small we'll catch up once a week to test what you're doing if you hate it if you love it we'll check out what you're doing in 3 months if you hate it this is the worst thing in the world then no stress we can shake hands and call it a day looking at that validating demands earlier on having those conversations dedicating time to it I think I've try the whole idea of going from a full-time job to your own startup and I think there's all those different stories of getting investment and so on if you transition that always is messy and it is always much more work than you think it' be great to do it 9 to5 for both jobs would be awesome but it never is testing validating the hell out of it until you get really consistent feedback that you you can almost predict what the next person's going to say doing those poc's and couple of them one's really good but then trying a couple of people and doing three-month versions of it if you love it keep going with it but the reason I like the PC's is that if it's not what you think say one person loves it but six others hate it and oh I'm not sure if I'm going to keep doing this or not this is not very good you've at least got that out at the three-month Mark or six month or whatever that time limit is so I think doing that transition researching the crap out of it validating with a simple MVP as possible because I think we pay so much attention to the the supply side of the market instead of the demand taking that time to really assess the Demar or saying expression of Interest Pages or weight list pages right if you can get people to enough traffic to it to at least validate and go like why would you use this why would you use it for give me a list of people if I can have 100 people on a weit list for a product idea fills me with more confidence that I'm like hey I'm happy to go back to parttime or take a couple months off launch this thing and see if I can get it going so I think being really clear on the demand is so important yeah and I think T really good in my next question what are the common mistakes I think one Comm is not looking at the demand side are there any other common mistakes you see when people try to build a micras I think being too tied to the product this probably goes for for sort of any industry I always think there's two types of startups right there's product obsess and customers customer obsessed people and I find when you get product obsessed and you've got an idea and I've been guilty of it you go down the rabbit hole and you you don't want to let go of this micro sess like it's simple it's easy it's to the point it'll just be great I don't want to over complicate I can build it like just not being afraid to go hey this is not going to work I'm actually going to focus on the pain Point more and keep pivoting around that and the other thing is I know when people work full-time and they do this as side project totally understandable I do it as well we seem to rush to automate very quickly or rush to scale things very quickly and again this goes tenfold to to normal St as well but that crawl walk Runner keep going back to it but it's try some ads for example try running ads or try an affiliate program or try different things but if you haven't yet had enough time where you've done it manually and heard the same response and got the same outcomes over and over again just don't rush to sink a lot of money into it because I've seen people who sink a lot of money into the product pour money into ads or pour money into Affiliates or Partnerships or sponsorships and all these different areas just to find out that 4% of their Market actually care about this thing yeah I think validating it focusing on the demand and not rushing to scale it when you're doing on your parttime doing it outside of your work hours like you we're all exhausted it's a lot of work and you just want to plug something in or hire that person spend a lot of money and just bring them in so they can do the lead gen stuff I've definitely had my fair share of those calls but it's so important in the early stage it's not just getting those first customers it is validating it and it's not just your first couple of MVPs it's continually trying to go does the market consistently want to buy this and if so great because I think that then feeds into your future do I keep this simple micros SAS and just triple down on it or do I look to build a couple of different areas to this and maybe build it out to a full size product love it we're going to move a little bit away from micras cuz you are in BB SAS in general as well and I might come to ask you to repeat yourself even more with these questions but feel free to do so because we're going to create summary episodes out of these when we let go a bit of the micro SAS and we when we talk about building a B2B SAS company what kind of advice would you give a f founder who's just starting out and grow to 10K monthly recur Revenue yep I think and I maybe I'll say in a sort of different more practical terms I think it's not being afraid to be manual with your go to market because I think I understand why we want to just automate it or do the magic of SEO and all of a sudden all these people start flooding to our products and these great words that I've even mentioned in this podcast around plg and growth Loops but I think in the early days I genuinely don't see a way around it just being very manual and not being afraid to I still stand by this I think everyone needs to at some point six to 12 months ideally two years go work in sales and go do it from the front ends go pitch people in the meeting and figure out how to get around objections and figure out your position because You' got to say it on the SP or go to a conference I did it for a customer the other day and I would have pitched it 30 times in a row by the end of it I was watching their reactions and what was going to work and not work I got back and then rewrote a big deck for a lot of their product messaging for their website and a bunch of different areas and it was just so much clearer and saved me so much time it was exhausting and uncomfortable in certain areas but just not being afraid to be manual not being understandbly if you got investment you've got runways like holding out on it as much as you can I think bootstrapping as far as you possibly can cuz and you you retain all the the creative freedom and I think sometimes markets need time there's a couple Industries I I work with now where they need a bit of time before the product they educate the market or they build up awareness and attention sort of interest and it does take time you look at Enterprise Products you've got sales cycles of 6 12 24 months long I think you've got to have that patience to really see it come to fruition I think being manual on that I think the first 10K and I'd even say this is probably a precursor to all these ones I mentioned a little bit before but I I really think now is to be a successful founder you've always got to have a really good personal brand is becoming super important and so I always try to say whatever you're in if you're a developer if you're a product marketer or product manager or sales or whatever you're in start creating your own content just become known a bit and just get your name out there because you know if you're someone like yourself youve worked really hard for this podcast fantastic if you hypothetically were to La launch your product tomorrow you've got an owned audience already and that's 99% of the heavy lifting there's something now that people saying you used to be products 10 years ago 105 years ago was the differentiator to success but now it's your distribution can you get in front of the right people fast enough in a shorter period of time and if you've got that personal brand you're going to come at it with so much more trust you've got a bunch of people that like you admire you and Trust what you say then endorsing a product is just takes out 10 steps I think looking at personal brand not being afraid to do things manually getting incredibly involved in the communities if you are a marketer making marketing products great you probably already got a network if you're not then that this advice probably goes twice for you is just get involved with as many areas you can I think I say to you the other day it's working with a client now and they say they're not marketers and they say they're not salespeople but they are so active in the community in this particular industry they travel to all the capital cities in Australia and they do speaking spots networking events coffee meetups and all these things and they are now renowned throughout the whole Community I haven't spent a scent as far as ads spend of course traveling and effort but they've built this personal brand now that people to they say hey I spoke to Simon who met you two years ago he he loves you guys he wants to be a part of it and when we looking at scaling doing things like regular webinars or regular newsletters or content pieces they've already got this huge audience and we're just nurturing them now we're not trying to start from scratch i' say the whole crawl walk run distribution I think there's a quote and I can't remember who the person said it but they said the first time found is obsessed about the product second time found is obsessed about distribution and it's once you you can have the perfect product in the world but until you can get out there people's eyeballs and definitely attention is becoming a very scarce resource so spend the time to create that attention first through your personal brand is one of the biggest lessons learn for me nice and then let's assume now we reached 10K Mr and we're going to make a huge jump towards 10 million AR what kind of advice would you give SAS Founders here it's a good one if I was doing that i' would probably retired i' say the companies I've worked with I think the ability and this is where I think there's a big Catch 22 when it comes to startups right because I think the best Founders in the early stages are the ones who are frankly chaotic they get out there they do stuff they try stuff they throw things at the wall and they keep it going and I think that probably gets you to your first 10K in my opinion that gets things moving but having the foresight the humility and the self-awareness to go hey this business is more important than my vision for for it like I still need to keep it there but being able to I think the ones I've seen that do really well can detach themselves in the right areas very well and I think Looking In terms have going to 10 mil in the early days like I think all all startups start with foundered sales and and they should as i s of saying before but then they bring people in they bring marketers in they bring sales people in they bring customers success people in and they attach and and let people slit into those roles so I think growing to the 10 million is being able to detach your way out of areas and be able to let go of certain things I think there's also those quotes you hear about people saying hi great people what's that Steve Jobs quotes don't hire smart people and get them to tell you what to do or something like that and I do agree with that to an extent when they take ownership but I think also back to that personal brand Point having that founder person at the head of the snake is so important even to 10 mil beyond that I think it's so important because people and speaking with the marketing hat on people love people they like Brands and they're into things like Nike and apple as far as Brands when you ever hear about Brands it's always Elon Musk right or Jeff Bezos or it's always the person it's never usually the brand so I think leaning on that personal brand detaching yourself out of the operations but staying in the front of that and these are very generic terms but I guess I'm seeing the ones where I see a lot of these companies when they reach these points start to fall down and I think it's like sometimes Founders go done my job I'm going to step out and give it over to someone else and I think you were the Visionary you had the idea I think you need to be involved in some way once it scales to that point if you're looking at 10 mil 10 mil AR you probably need to look at more like culture and I know again that's a very generic comment but I think I see so many awesome businesses with great products start to deteriorate when the culture is not LED well at the top there's like ability or seeing a found out 10 million AR company who's willing to go to a conference do a speaking spot or jump on a call or lead from the front and keep that accountability I think this handsfree syndrome can crush a lot of really great companies when they detach too much and they just let everything go well from there bringing the right people in keeping them involved but great Founders need to sit on top of it the whole time still be in the driver's seat to some extent still have their personal brand and still give the company something to lead toward yeah as far as it's technical side of things I probably have to depends which product it is if it turns into an Enterprise product or b2c or whatever is I think that's varies a bit but I think the companies I see scaling well and sustainably tend to have a really good culture that starts from the top down sounds like a bit of a self-help talk but it is so true a good founder at the top is worth weight and gold nice nice love it I am going to try to summarize so where we go all the way back to the beginning M micro assas it's a simple version of assas so it has one user one Persona one solution after one person building it it is going to force you to do at the best practice so start really really Niche why should you consider it it has lower pricing less objections low running cost low expectations we will need to be able to Pivot quickly validate your ID being able to sell be good with UI ux and plg when you are going to build find the ID so ideally have the paint P yourself be in the market you're going to build within if not research it a lot check negative reviews on review sites and see if you can break it down into a small product before even writing a line of code build a pitch tack so you can actually validate your ID when you're able to launch it do outbound but not mass spamming ask for feedback instead of selling people build up a waiting list leverage a survey to qualify people and build a database from that leverage other communities by joining webinars podcasts but lead with value first and then sell focus on the long term when you're ready to scale plg has to be in place and working keep your margin in order get insights into your analytics but remember easy and easy out so make sure you handle churn you will have to look at growth loops and know where your micras fits in you can also make your SAS exit ready by the example of hop you gave and then know where are your buyers and why are they buying and ideally start building a personal brand as a Founder some common mistakes don't rush into things scraw walk run not looking at the demand side keep validating be customer obsessed not product obsessed and then when we go more Broad towards bdb SAS um are not being afraid of being manual with your goto market so go work in sales try to figure out how to deal with objections start creating content start building that personal brand and if you want to start scaling towards 10 million AR do more webinars content pieces bring in the right people go from chaos to detaching yourself from certain areas but not too much because you will need to be leading at the front while also being building a good culture well that's way more succinct than I could have done it thank you for that I we don't need an AI for that 100% there you go there's a product that they approved manually done nice we're going to link towards your LinkedIn profile your sub newsletter the Lee marketing fun you mentioned I think you have an article regarding that as well I will link also towards adify the
