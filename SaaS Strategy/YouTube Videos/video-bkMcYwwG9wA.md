today we're talking about the top three mistakes that SAS companies make when building a tech company in 2025 let's go ahead and get started mistake number one is having a great product yes having a great product that happens to be an incomplete solution is a major mistake here's what I mean if your codebase and your features are amazing but your customers don't get results it's not a good solution even if the tech stack the product the features are really good there is a gap between the product and the outcome and in 2025 the only thing that matters is customers get really good outcomes if they don't know how to use the product that is on you that is your fault and that is your mistake if they use the product incorrectly even if you built the code correctly that is your problem your mistake because they didn't get the outcome that you promised them right so the key here is to not overly focus on the product on features on the codebase but be obsessive not about technical stuff but about customers getting good outcomes no matter why they aren't currently that's the single most important number two is not knowing what percentage of your customers get a successful outcome that they've been promised during sales within 90 days most SAS starts have no idea if their customers are getting their promises met that were made to them during the sales process you want to strive for a 100% success rate in terms of promised outcome within 90 days or whatever is appropriate for your particular industry if you don't know what percentage of your customers are successful start there the final big mistakes St startups make in 2025 is having poor unit economics what I mean by that is some ratio that measures how expensive is it to get a customer relative to much money they bring in over their lifetime this is typically measured by one of two or three different ratios lifetime value over a CAC CAC payback period or SAS magic number of those three my favorite is the CAC payback period that means taking how much money it costs to acquire a customer say it costs $1,000 to go buy a customer or acquire one versus how much income and revenue you bring in from that one customer on a monthly basis so if it cost you $1,000 to go acquire a customer and they bring in a month recurring revenue of $100 it takes you 10 months worth of monthly recurring Revenue to recover your $1,000 customer acquisition cost that's a 10mon CAC payback period and you ideally want to have your CAC payback period Under 12 months if you're around 6 months that is fabulous now there's a couple reasons why your CAC payback period might not be very good number one you're not charging enough money to generate enough lifetime value to have a CAC payback period that's shorter number two your product isn't useful enough it's not creating enough value to justify having a higher price point and as a result it becomes very inefficient financially to acquire a customer because you don't earn enough money back from them after you do and finally the third factor that can really uh script your unit economics is having a very inefficient sales process to go acquire a customer if you can acquire a customer for $1,000 versus $100,000 for the same kind of offering at the same price point obviously it's much better to have a lower customer acquisition cost so that gets into sales efficiency how well you run your sales and marketing operations and who you're targeting from a customer and how hard it is to reach them so those are my top three mistakes for building a St startup in 2025 you've been warned don't make them now go for it if you found this video helpful be sure to follow And subscribe to my channel so you'll get more videos just like this any questions leave a comment I'll be happy to answer them.
