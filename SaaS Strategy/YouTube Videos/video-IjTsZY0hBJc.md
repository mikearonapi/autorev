very happy and excited to be joined by Lindsay zerman Lindsay is a an advisor at techstars and demand Maven we've been connected for a while now but I guess we just like uh connected regarding the the podcast a few weeks ago and I'm very excited to be joined by Lindsay today um and we will be discussing some very interesting things Lindsay welcome to the podcast thanks George I'm so happy to be so I've been alive I've been eager to learn from everybody you've had on the show I'm grateful for the invite oh that's interesting I mean when people say that I I always want to ask like what's your opinion about the podcast if we need to change anything if we need to like do things differently but I guess we can discuss that after after the the recording right uh for now can we can we start with your background um today you are an advisor uh at techstars and also demand Maven but what has brought you to to where you are today uh can you share a few things about your your journey sure um well over the years I've been leading SEO conversion rate optimization uh web product management sort of web ownership go to market strategy digital marketing product marketing and growth marketing so uh the way I got sort of started was uh in advising uh Founders and co-founders pre first marketing hire that was a really exciting thing to get to do and has given me probably the most strength in my career um or my biggest strength in my career which is to work scrappily um when you're working in the startup mode certainly you know resources aren't uh always completely abundant and so I actually particularly love to work in the organic space as a result of that but I've I've pictured it broadly since the beginning I also got into SEO more than 10 years ago before there were these specializations around content Technical and Link building and so I've kept my skill set uh you know comfortable and familiar in-depth and current with the broad sphere of what SEO can mean and do and I've even found that there are some cool ways that SEO can you know help support uh even on the product side and on the go to market side around like app store or listings marketplaces other digital Footprints and I think of websites as the um kind of the path from the Wilds of the world to the brand and the first experience of the brand and then from the first experience of the brand to revenue and it really work to think holistically about that customer journey and go ahead and like ladder up to higher performance higher kpi attainment um so yeah I think that's a little bit about my background more recently I was on the board of United search which is an organization that's committed to connecting um underrepresented people in SEO with opportunities to speak on the stage so I was connecting them with mentors and uh speaking opportunities as well um you know SEO is a really diverse there's a really diverse community of seos out there and so we just wanted to see there be a Level Playing Field and opportunity for everyone and then advising with techstars is really cool there's a new uh program in Oakland that I can speak to basically uh that's you know giving people this cohort coming into the inaugural year is 12 different companies across fintech proptech uh cleantech and Tech and War and basically is coming together powered by JPMorgan accelerator and each of the companies will get mentorship in a personalized way I'm particularly leading the GTM and growth marketing uh kind of mentorship component of the program there are other professionals that will be there to different VCS and entrepreneurs to really help cultivate the entrepreneurship or the the startups that are present and get them access to resources and support in addition to funding for people who don't know techstars is an accelerator right yeah it is it's essentially all the resources and network that you would need hopefully to really get off the ground and have a successful go at it from the start I don't know but I always think that things are very difficult in the in the early days of uh of a of a sales company at any company for that matter right because as you as you mentioned earlier it's pretty Scrappy you know at that stage I mean so many assumptions so many things you don't know and so many things that can change moving forward right but I would like to kind of touch um something that you mentioned which is product and let's say more broadly speaking product marketing and the connection that product marketing can have with SEO and I guess my question is what is the connection between product marketing and SEO and what can be done to help product marketing if you know uh there is anything to be done to help product marketing through SEO sure yeah yeah I worked in these small scales and then sort of scaled to global company uh growth leadership and the the role that I uh first took in an Enterprise scale was that I began leading the um the digital and web components of growth for a business unit so I own many websites and helped manage developers and you know queue up a roadmap and all of it including starting the SEO and conversion rate optimization programs at the company and sort of leading the data privacy initiative as well it was during the times of GPR at the time um so that was my first uh opportunity to really work inside a skilled team and um you know it wasn't just the leadership team um that I was working directly with to you know suggest ideas for improving product Market fed or going to Market and launching a new product and I remember starting to really see this energy at that time being able to work directly with product marketers um so much of what I used to do was now in the sphere of another team and so I found it interesting I learned a lot about how to collaborate across teams and how to be effective at shaping go to market strategy and even product strategy as an SEO from the product marketer side from the product side I think there are huge benefits to collaborating with SEO role because they might not say it this way but seos are expert Market researchers this is what we do all day long and I think that the Synergy of working like closely together can basically improve the performance of both teams efforts so I've seen it done I got to work on quite a lot of these projects around like product launches over the years I think that once uh you kind of I start to identify like particular areas where product marketing and SEO can work tightly together and improve both sides performance I would deem you know product naming and solutions page Gap analysis those are huge so you know in marketing teams we talk to each other all day long and I think there's the risk we run the risk in the marketing team of speaking to each other the language we created with the effort of of or the goal of demand generation so we want to say get people interested in in a new offering and so we might create a new name for it um an example of that could be like augmented intelligence or any other kind of like language that you've crafted with your product team or with your marketing team internally and the cool thing is that there's like data coming through market research tools like SEO tools semrush Etc about what people are already searching for you can also even look at the App Store space and start to like research like what people are looking for in the app space um or in marketplaces what are people looking to review sites to to go purchase and when product marketing and SEO are tightly aligned basically product marketers get to benefit by having like Intel in advance of launching about what various ways of naming things or messaging their uh new launch would actually do so they can predict performance and seos can basically um I hate to say it this way because it sounds a little bit you know it sounds like a cheat code or something but basically product marketers can perform better in their roles and look really fabulous when they uh think about Chuck checking in with the SEO first on their team so like let me tell you a story about basically how I I figure this out at IBM I got a doc it was like a product launch documentation for a product launch plan and we had some of this language that um we used internally a lot we were calling stuff at that time augmented intelligence and I think there was a document where the the title or the name for the product was going to be something like augmented intelligence for sales solution um and I just I read that and I try to think you know empathetically with the the market in that case was a salesperson a sales manager I try to think like that Prospect and I was thinking man if I was a sales manager would I know what that meant and um and and how much of my brain is it taking up you know in conversion rate optimization one of the core uh things that we always need to think about is how convenient and obvious are we making ourselves um how wantable are we making ourselves when we present this content so I found that uh particularly thinking about calling something augmented intelligence for you know sales solution it had several abstract Concepts and things that I wasn't familiar with and I was not sure that it made sense to me as a reader of the doc and so I thought okay well I know we're getting we're getting at here is like we want to help sales people through automating a part of their process and making them work smarter not harder um what if we try to use an analogy that they already know at the time smartphones were huge and you know Universal already and so I thought you know can we just use the word smart because that's essentially what we're doing we're sort of like making your sales motion a little bit easier with your application stack so yeah we ended up going to Market with a different name we went we went to Market with a smart sales assist as a name for that product offering um and I think that that's kind of the thought process right SEO can also bring um not just like you know naming ideas but like data and intelligence behind the naming ideas so we go into keyword research tool and we can pull you know 200 different potential product or feature names solution use case names and then we can go through those and sort of look at like the match between the highest volume least tapped opportunity and the fit for the product so we can sort of find this um almost kind of magical Synergy sometimes where there's a term out there that has untapped demand it's not really being competed over heavily but if we name the product or the solution or the feature alongside that term we could certainly have a really strong success Foundation from the start because we can tap organic traffic it we don't have to pay for so it makes the whole launch more efficient and broadens the reach of it if we go to market that way if you know you already have a product or a solution in Market the other thing that you can do with an SEO is you can actually have the SEO like go out there and research like did we cover all of the things that people would be typing into Google if they were searching for this offer and often seos can just unearth like untap demand that way and create new Solutions Pages alongside you so I think for product marketers is a real um career benefit and performance benefit to kind of tapping that asset of the SEO as Market researcher um and uh you know I can give like one other example that Guru offers that so I've worked with a lot of different tech companies in my career I don't want to name a bunch of things but I think Guru is one of the coolest apps that I've seen out there so essentially it's a platform that takes a company Wiki uh with you as you work let's say you're working in Salesforce and in intercom the guru Wiki actually opens up in a browser extension in like the side and so you can like reference the documentation or the process or the brand guidelines in the same browser without having to change context or lose your kind of focus so I think that's a that's a really cool application but we had something that was basically like a free knowledge based software so you can call it a company Wiki or a free internal knowledge base and um I I found that when we named the product in alignment with untapped demand that there was a real change in terms of driving like the most efficient group available so for example we have a a guru there's like a page that I hope to optimize around free knowledge base software and that page is just a really wonderful bread and butter page that that connects direct to directly to bottom of the funnel conversion do you think the the reason why this happens is because it's or one of the reasons why this happens is also because it's easier for people to to understand like make the connection and or the association and say okay yeah this is what this is all about these are the like potential benefits it may it may have and I'm thinking about cases like for example drift giving the the name and evangelizing the like starting a movement let's say or a new category conversational marketing which is kind of easy to understand like okay it's going to be around conversations and how I can do marketing through like some sort of conversation right or um gong's Revenue intelligence I think they they call it so I guess my question is do you think that one of the reasons why this works better is also because it makes it easier for people to kind of make the association and say okay it's easy for me to to understand without having to think about what this like you know this term May May imply it's easy and straightforward and I I can like grasp it right away legibility like understanding the concept of right away helps with conversion remembering and discoverability so if you're gonna go create a category what I've found is typically most successful is heavy investment so in drift's case they heavily invested in content strategy and getting that messaging out there they created such a huge Content Library they have e-guides or ebooks that you can download through an interaction with the conversational tool that was huge for them their content strategy is on point and I I deeply respect their leadership for uh going there and not every application uh not every company will have that level of resourcing available we also know that AI is affecting the market for content and content as a channel so if you were to go to market you might need to think about you know allocating resources differently today than you would have at the start of drift's time so there are factors in play that that play into that sort of strategic decision making what I would say is though the category creation route is just more resource intensive and it's more or less likely to be successful depending on how self-explanatory your new category title is so using conversational marketing marketing just like you said it makes sense it it uh it says what it is and so it's memorable um and it's recognizable uh right away um whereas uh let me make a good example that's less so um let's say you were going to Market as um you know I keep coming back to this term augmented intelligence it was a trend back in marketing a little while ago um it didn't get picked up by people who were receiving that Marketing in fact um you know I think that what we what we still use and what is still more effective uh for us in terms of connecting with people intuitively so that they know exactly what we're talking about is automation or Ai and so we've got this uh really exciting opportunity if we think about um we just think critically about like strategy at this earlier stage and decide based on how much resource we want to put towards things I mean in this economy I think that Scrappy is the name of the game for staying you know in a in a strategic position and uh you might consider using uh aligned naming to tap on tap command organically to really captured more organic growth and discoverability rather than having to heavily pay to play paying through rich content generation ads you know paid channels generally might be a little bit of a heavy investment for companies at this time I think that we could go on and on here and I mean I next question I would ask would be what do you think about like us using organic growth acceleration but I will not ask it uh at least uh why why while we you know uh are recording this episode speaking of Scrappy um I would like to discuss a bit doing marketing and like or more broadly speaking let's say go to market strategy for earlier stage companies and I would like to because you you've worked with with such components right and based on your experience how do you think a SAS company should think and approach content and SEO in earlier stages yeah so in earlier stages I think you know if you have a marketer on the team um the most likely configuration that I've seen often is there's someone owning like the CMO or VP role in marketing they're typically coming from a product marketing background um often that's a strategic first hire more recently sometimes we see like dementia and head of growth type titles but typically those people come with product marketing product Market fit messaging kind of skills um you know I think that they kind of come with a skill set right and um at the company level it's really important to do a lot of strategic investing and really go after low-hanging fruit if you are an SEO like doing consulting with a company at that stage auditing a website is like a really standard engagement and so I would speak to both sides and say in a website audit you know the best website audit is going to come from a foundation of working with whoever is functionally owning the product management leadership role in the company at that time whether that's the the actual CEO or founder or that's like a VP or head of marketing the pmm can basically provide personas and if you start your audit not with the goal of doing the standard SEO thing which is you know we go and we look at Technical and content gaps and what content refreshes we would recommend and we look at content opportunities to create new content but instead start with a framework of the person to whom you will present the work you can often present differently and encourage implementation much more so than if you took an SEO lens and presented say the 200 things that we should do from an SEO perspective so the way that I've worked my process in that early stage is to start with Gathering whatever insights we have about personas if we don't have personas yet then I would look at recorded sales calls or sit in on some sales calls to start to generate a Persona or look at existing customer research so pmms are like a rich source whoever leads the product marketing role is a is a rich source of interview insights and Prospect research and customer research so taking that kind of person and picturing them is a really great starting point I typically will take three different types of communities and audit from their point of views so starting with the Persona instead of starting with the SEO goals and let's say those groups tend to be the same depending on the model of the company um they might vary but you usually have a prospect Persona you can roll up all of the different kinds of prospects into one if the company has gotten rich with their Persona creation customer Persona so like an actual user um and then finally probably like an analyst press type audience because early stages it's really so essential to get initial coverage um and like discoverability among that amongst that analyst community and to clearly Market your product to them and show them the value so those three kinds of groups I would take a look at a site from a journey analysis perspective rather than from an SEO perspective first what I mean by that is think about like what are the landing pages for a particular Persona where do they typically go next and next and next Google analytics have an amazing tool for this it's basically a behavior flow chart and you can use these custom audiences and Google analytics to sort of create like a segment so let's say this if you want to identify a prospect on the page then you find one page on your site that only prospects would really go to like the free trial page let's say and you look at those prospects and you say okay who we want to understand uh we want to understand two groups of prospects people who actually completed the trial people who didn't complete the trial you create a couple of custom audiences there and then you'd have prospects identified and you can take that custom audience and bring basically look at any view any report in Google analytics specifically for that audience and for that funnel drop off so you can understand what are the pages that people typically look at before they don't complete trial form and before they do complete the trial form and start to understand that journey and then from there I would go through each page on the journey and I would start an SEO audit from that perspective how can we improve this journey we often think about SEO performance in an analytical way I like to think of it visually like what what is missing from these Pages where are the bottlenecks or the points of friction on these Pages what messaging is missing did we Market accidentally to an HR leader when we should have been marketing to an I.T and Ops leader did we mention like Enterprise grade security and reliability that objection you know that that a lot of it and Ops folks might have um did we miss that we were actually marketing to the finance guy or the finance woman and we needed an Roi calculator to show that there was a heavy Roi in this fiscal environment right now you know it's more than half of people in companies making a B2B Buy will actually have that buying process include approval from multiple c-suite and CEO stakeholders and more than half of people also are experiencing that like they want to do a self-serve trial instead of like talk to you in a demo so you don't get kind of like getting into the head of the audience and understanding where the the bottlenecks and points of friction are and where the gaps were from the content perspective those things I I've presented and uh they've been really successful at landing and I'll present them alongside SEO findings that say we also realize we have a Solutions page Gap and these 10 pages ought to be created and then finally these types of strategies for earlier stage companies really need to be heavily focused on revenue and customer lifetime value drivers so it's not enough to really focus on like type of funnel widening the funnel I would present like a funnel graphic instead and say okay we've got let's say I really want to get done 10 content opportunities because I know that they'll be strategic and acquisition and in conversion I would present those in a funnel instead of just as a list of content opportunities I would say these are a type of funnel mid funnel and bottom of funnel opportunities that we have here are the relative sizes of those opportunities and this is why I think those pages deserve to be created so really just shifting the way we communicate as seos into the language and the Frameworks of whoever is there in an early stage company really helps with retaining clients it helps with being understood and getting buy-in and making sure your stuff has the resources to get done I would also say that one of the things of seos we often do is deliver something that's like the 200 item checklist right um if you want to be retained and engaged within a client relationship if you want to be most valuable to a client or to your manager it can help not to show the 200 things it can help to say there are 200 things but I've pulled these ones because they're the most critical next steps for us that will deliver highest Starlight and to really be able to curate that instead of overwhelming routine it's really helpful um I would also say that that it's like really really really really really useful to getting things done if you hand off not just like a big long presentation but instead um just show the relevant part of a presentation to the stakeholders that need to be involved to implement it so say you have a Dev team or a developer that you're pulling from product um can you walk that person through um you know tickets instead of a long presentation maybe if you've already written up a ticket the format they already use save them a little bit of time having to do that project management you're more likely to get it done the ticket would just be like what we need to do and why and the use cases for testing um a little user story about what what the feature would look like or any technical requirements that you have and if there is somebody who's kind of a gatekeeper working with the development resource do you talk to their manager and walk through the presentation really briefly five slides with them and why you wanted to what you're hoping to get done and then maybe at that point like suggesting that we take a tour of the business valuation of each of these opportunities so you can give a sense of what you would expect in terms of performance returns um you know just just so that you can make sure to get it done I certainly wouldn't you know in an early stage company I certainly wouldn't go do the like long checklist of 100 technical optimization just um it's like the right move at the right time and so having a strong technical Foundation at the beginning is awesome if you can get 100 things done in the first website launch but if the site's already out there then I'm starting to sort of sift through and look for the highest player in things from a technical perspective and focusing only on those um so I hope that starts to answer your question I have many more things I can say um I think that in the earlier stages it's critical that you go after what will work um and so in your company you can actually mine data around your paid testing programs so like in your paid search program or if you have an app in the app store you can mine data and see like what are you already doing what content is already what terms you're targeting are already converting and generating revenue and in those funnels that are working really well those terms will be things to look at like do we want to create an organic page around this um you also probably want to think about Evergreen tactics so um you know how do I put this I think there's a there's a real short-term long-term trade-off um so you can invest in like quality Rich experiences and creativity in ux right now because AI has just introduced this giant change in the market where suddenly the barrier to entry in creating written content is much lower now I think that is going to create a future in which we have a deluge of written content that's all universally sharing the same information and so to stand out from that you have to think about well this this environment is going to encourage the typical adjustment of scaling content creation that is what most companies will have the resources and the mindset to do but what they won't all do becomes critical because that's how you can stand out amongst other companies in search now think about Authority building that's a lot harder than content creation Now and so investing there heavily would be good and strategic and Evergreen also thinking about like how do we like make our creative Stand Out do we provide personal perspectives do we provide creative examples do we use video video is huge I mean I actually um was on the leadership team for a video SEO agency and um really got to do a lot of client delivery of like video scripts and content calendars and launch plans for YouTube YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world and so you get this sense of um once content is a sea of universally informational content the information is no longer the competition the competition is the innovation how do we use video how do we use ux how do we use creative angles how do we even like write a contrarian piece so I've seen it I've seen it done that you can take a term that no one even realized was a commercial term and build a commercial presence there Guru did this brilliantly my former manager Leah Friedman she did an amazing job of identifying an opportunity around Knowledge Management now if you went and searched for Knowledge Management before she came onto the scene um basically that footprint was like a bunch of academic pages about Knowledge Management now it's a category term and a known acquisition term in the market for creating a company Wiki or creating a company internet or creating a company internal knowledge base or internal comms portal um she created that she created that commercial footprint and it wasn't even something that people knew about so I think that there's an opportunity to write things that don't yet exist and stay on the edge I'd want to be you know listening in on Google Trends all the time if you pick up on a new term that you haven't heard before maybe assume it might be a Google Trend that you ought to check out a few times getting in first is going to be huge for a trend trending piece of potential content so there's a lot there's a lot to be said here but I would just say you know the world is changing and the people that will uh eat everyone's lunch are the people who change fastest and think about Divergent strategies not just what everyone will do which is skill content creation Now you can also scale content creation because in the short term that will work but in the long term it's not the the Evergreen strategy so I would say you know an evergreen strategy around creating content is building authoritativeness which could be that you create a really strong Content Library right now that's completely thorough related to a particular topic that kind of creating the universe of all of the topics and and terms around a topic and creating amazing ux to be able to you know get people to navigate through that entire library that that could be an evergreen piece for you because you've established topical Authority and authoritativeness um but certainly just going out and creating more blogs at a faster Pace I don't think will be um what works in three years oh uh this this answer covers many of the questions I I wanted to ask uh during this this interview that was very very deep like I really liked many of the points that you that you outlined and discussed one question I have for you and I I would like to kind of shift gears a bit and discuss monitoring and evaluating on performance and I would like to know in your experience what are the key metrics that help you evaluate Quantum Performance and how in general you approach evaluation and ensuring that you know the content we produce like gets us the result that we want which of course may not be the same for every content type right and Conan format but I would like to hear your thoughts on that yeah absolutely I think whatever gets the furthest along aligning with the company's goals is actually what seos can measure and sort of try to excel at so if a company's North Star is customer lifetime value you know really working uh internally with your analytics team and understanding like what are the best predictive indicators of customer lifetime value that we have that might be demo creation that might be a webinar conversions it might be leads generated it might be trial starts um whatever is the sort of formula for predicting customer lifetime value or recurring Revenue that's what I'd be aiming for not uh views of pages but um really being able to ideally using a multi-touch model understand the journey and how much impact you're having across the journey and if you haven't gotten to that maturity stage of having multi-touch attribution available in the company then I think it's some it's critical to show a story where SEO is improving customer lifetime value now if you hit a wall where it's challenging to measure that one of the things you can do is diversify um what you're doing in your SEO program and I think this is strategic because of the changes introduced in the market as well it's the kind of stuff that not everyone will do so you can think about you know marketplaces review sites and app store listing optimization and seos have unique skills to be able to help in all of those areas no one came to me and said Lindsay you know what you could go do um App Store optimization or category creation on G2 um sorry a category launch on G2 or a product hunt launch I just decided that these were the needs of the company at the time and even in an SEO titled role kind of just presented the opportunity and got buy-in and got them done and they were quite successful things to do from an SEO perspective because they helped me build Authority or to build a revenue pipeline or to show you know my impact across the company so um let's start with one you know if you if you are in SEO and you see that you're in a space where you know Gartner and G2 are like important ways that people discover software and tools like yours um you could go to G2 and take all of the you know crawl the categories Pages um go ahead and do a pass and say like here's what's relevant to our offering um and then go ahead and uh you know you can verify that by hand just like you would with like looking at a search like a new content opportunity you could look at the category and make sure that there are competitors like you a fast way to do this is to take a competitor and find out what category Pages they're already on okay you want to try to find like your competitor that's the best of the most in that platform for sure um but let's say on G2 you discover a new category um that maybe is a great opportunity or four it's pretty straightforward you can run those then through stem rush and make sure they're all getting traffic um I would you know prioritize by the actual discoverability of the page for the category um and then walk over to the product marketing manager the product marketing lead and say well I think we have an opportunity to go to market here what do you think and if they they can see it too if you can present it clearly and they they have the bandwidth to take this on they can help you pilot a new category launch um so I did this at Guru with our product marketing manager Kate Hudson who is brilliant she is like such a Powerhouse um and we uh then kind of tag teamed it you know she she ended up like launching us in a new category and um it became the bread and butter category for the company in 2022 it was actually so successful um and we were spending knowledge on G2 as a result of all this work like um it's like a top 100 in a top 50 software in various categories um even like the remote software category a remote work software which is like so General it's like slack and Gmail and Google Drive and stuff um and and by doing that launch like we had a resilient position in 2022 for a market that was evolving so we wouldn't have even had that had I not like stepped a little bit toward the lane on the other side and you know to do this and not like leave your colleagues feeling like you're encroaching is this like sort of critical right because if you're in SEO can you come into a room whether you're a consultant or you're in-house and you say this is what we should do and this is what's wrong that's really hard it's easy to alienate people instead of working across the aisle so I went to Kate like one-on-one we got to know each other as people we like each other we get to work together yay this is great I shared with her draft ideas and opportunities over and over again and we partnered and launched a whole bunch of stuff that was successful another one was looking at App Store listings so you know we we had a um an app that was not discoverable unless you knew the name of the brand and you'd have to go search Guru to find Guru and I thought you know we offer a thing it's not a thing that people would search Guru for they would search knowledge base they would search Company Wiki they would search Internal Documentation platform you know Internal Documentation and so I um just hunted around and like found a lot of Target terms that we could potentially be ranking for that were non-brand and then provided that opportunity over the product marketing team again I wrote some sample copy of like how our listing could read and pointed out how the creative could evolve the creative at the time is just the uh the logo the word guru well what's that was it legible could we could we show people what it was in an obvious way um through some sort of new creative and so essentially the same skill set that makes someone really great at SEO is exactly the skill set that would make someone really great at App Store optimization or ASO even ASA app store ad creation um so I just like to to kind of think about this and think in the language of the person that I'm talking to so that you can talk across the aisle um also pmms you know product marketing managers they are like interviewing customers all day or interviewing prospects all day and they can help you out a lot as an SEO if you just have them ask for you on those interview calls like when they're when they're like learning about a prospect what did you search for when you found us um you know getting things done like you can get things done so so well with a partnership across the aisle by just being approachable and caring about the person first and not calling them out in a group like don't don't go into a group call as a presenter and say these are the problems of the website that's so so easy to alienate someone and end up um you know having people sort of detract from wanting to keep you around um and then finally I would just say there's lingo that pmms have product marketing managers have that seos don't often use but if we learn it we can present really well to that community and get things done much more often they think about strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats or SWAT this is a framework and they essentially have a grid and you put strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats and different kind of quadrants of the grid and then you could present your SEO strategy that way you could say here are strings we have an amazing you know PR team and so we have tons of authority developed and all these links from all these press sites and we're doing wonderfully there but we have a weakness of missing content gaps for these Solutions pages and we have a threat of you know atlassian is up and coming in this category and they're releasing some new thing that will compete with us so let's like take that as motivation actually to implement this plan quickly they think about GTM plans so um as a device as an advisor in techstars and at demand Maven I basically work in a product marketing function um helping to work with Founders to establish their first go to market plans so a GTM plan would have things like uh positioning you know seos can influence positioning we do the market research to understand positioning and what critical terms uh have demand for our product inside of them and we can say like here's a great Target term for the home page can we consider this in our positioning statement does it still align with what the product marketing team would like to get done messaging core value propositions we often have a sense intuitively of what users were looking for from looking at search content and understanding search intent so we might be able to offer up things like well our page you know didn't cover this part of what Searchers were looking for and we add that to our core value propositions and work and partner with product marketer that way and a GTM plan often there's like a Content strategy so there's we're going to create these new pages on the website can you as an SEO provide the ideas to that and or add to that and really make sure that it includes SEO pages so that there's an efficient way to grow the footprint of the product and you don't have to pay to play to establish ourselves in the market positioning for a product marketer is going to be like driven by what's called a job to be done for a jtbd and that's basically like the most common thing that prospects are are willing to hire Your solution to do so if you wanted to talk to a product marketer about affecting positioning you could say hey I know like where why we have it this way and I think that maybe the way that people said it on the phone calls um might have like on the interviews might have been different than what people type into search it turns out if we want to be discoverable for both like this might be a Synergy where we could name it this way into this target term in this way and find that we would you know cover more bases in terms of being discoverable and connecting with what people wanted us to do for them um and then finally like they talk all the time about like a product launch plan or a feature launch plan or Persona creation so can you you know get in the mindset of like aligning with their work there and contributing um if you can speak across the aisle that way I think you can find that there's a whole lot more that you can roll out as a combo marketing team and that this particular Duo of product marketing and SEO is like such a powerful unlock and unleash her product LED growth in particular so that's where I'm coming from is kind of like having worked on both sides and working across the aisle it's it's amazing to see how much is possible when seos like stay in their stay respectful but don't stay in a lane in early stages having a lane carved out is potentially dangerous I I don't want to say something controversial but essentially if you hire an SEO in an early stage company and you don't give them like purview into like helping out with the app store listing or other areas there's a risk for your company that you're spending on SEO when the lowest hanging fruit and the highest Roi opportunities would actually be broader than that so after having lead growth and really LED like product marketing and growth marketing it's clear to me that those trade-offs are there and that an SEO can step up to the plate and be essential and provide a lot of value to a company if they can say gracefully we have these opportunities over here where my SEO skill set can help why don't we talk about the opportunities that we have for Marketplace launches category launches Marketplace optimization and app store listing optimization those two can be really huge spread and better for the company too I would just say I'm a big fan of wearing many hats and um you know kind of entrepreneurial enough that I I didn't stick in a lane and it's really it's really clear that there's a lot of untapped money on the table uh through sort of going a little bit outside of what we conventionally think of as SEO that makes sense as we as we were running out of time I have one last question for you which is kind of your thoughts on the future of like I don't know go to market or content SEO for for sales and tech companies what do you think the the future holds for these companies yeah that's a really good question and particularly timely um you know I've mentioned some of the things but I think we can look to the next year to really be about if you look at a market for all content strategy we'll see a lot of content strategy acceleration content creation acceleration uh we'll see a lot of content refresh acceleration so we'll see a lot more competition over the informational components of content what that means is in three four five years um that will be so saturated that we can't compete over that anymore that's just not going to be able to be a viable single tactic strategy anymore so we have to start pushing ourselves a little bit you know I think the first time I um wrote a video script and a storyboard or the first time I produced uh photography and video I was nervous like it was uncomfortable uh because I was like oh no I'm doing this new thing and who who am I to say that I can do it I had a little bit of like imposter syndrome come up um and yet I did it and the results looked really professional I even uh gosh I was running this one uh shoot and one of our actors didn't show up so I had to be in the in the shoot oh this is so uncomfortable and uh and yet it turned out okay it actually looked like a really professional marketing so if you don't have a video producer if you don't have a voiceover actor or a budget for one um like how do you get into other media and provide multimedia digital experiences that are creative and Innovative that actually add value that just isn't out there it doesn't have to be hard you know one way you could make a YouTube video would be like an informational explainer video and you know you just work at the brand Team or whoever you're designing minor is and say you know I need these slides or just like quick animation slides would be faster right can you get them to make you seven slides and then you do a voiceover for it it doesn't have to be a nightmare and you might find that you record yourself and you actually sound way more professional than you felt you might feel nervous but it actually can be done scrappily to make podcasts audio video what if you took your uh your content that currently is acquisition content that's just content strategy like writing and maybe a couple branded assets and thought differently about that like could you provide a an audible version of it like could you provide a podcast and a downloadable ebook version of it so that I can save it in any format what about if you had a Blog and instead of just being a Blog it was like Pinterest and you could get hard to save content that you wanted to come back to when you provided a digital experience of a library to your users or to your prospects where they could save things and be logged in and access their whole Library what if if you had to do that what content would you write that would be different than what you write today like it would have to be higher value so you might have to give away more you might have to start talking to your product team or your customer success team and really getting personal perspective on like expert level guidance that is beyond what's published on the internet today some people have talked about taking your informational content and putting a gate in front of it that's going to be hard because you have to pay to play to have that discovered or create some sort of viral growth plan to to get it out there um in order to do that what about the alternative which is you still have the free content out there but you allow people to consume in any media that they prefer and they can also give you an email and download it or access it in your Rich library that feels to them like Kindle that feels to them like they really have a valuable set of guides that they're going to learn from they're training themselves for their future career and you're benefiting because you're generating an obvious brand aware product aware user you'll see you as the expert in what you do instead of a print book which you know used to be a really big trend for marketers to sort of create a book about their SAS tool um or a kind of thought leadership book what if that was a part of your Kindle library your Kindle ask Library for success um you know we think about emotional resonance personal perspective uniqueness those are all going to be must-haves let's say you had um you know you have a robot that can dance right and that's like showing showing off what your status tool can do can you make a digital experience that has that could you make a cool video game that is so awesome and retro but like displays your time series data application or your conversational application like I can chat with with Mario ask characters in a 1990s style game could you make it so cool that your digital experience is one that I would want to share and could you think about like leveraging shareability as a way to build Authority right like we I feel like seo's um we have evangelized our channel for a long time and it's amazing what's happening with that you know Tick Tock and YouTube and Instagram are like search engines to younger folks so if you look at the way people search for information or younger that might not go to Google making sure to have campaigns like that that are cool enough that you can leverage them for SEO Authority building SEO link building and also they would be cool enough that someone would want to share it on Tick Tock or would want to share it on Instagram I mean you just it's just really about thinking differently right now and I think that there's a really cool opportunity for seos to really up level our careers and our growth by like putting our toe in the water in other media that we might typically not go to or in other channels that we might typically not affect thinking about cross-channel resonance like how do we how do we have a growth plan for promoting our content that's Innovative because that actually might stick better um yeah I've changed the Changers the the fast move Changers grow the best yeah many good points I like that I like this idea of like and I guess that this is where things are are moving towards especially with the commoditization of content and especially with the rise of AI content and generative AI in general this was all very insightful Lindsay thank you very much
