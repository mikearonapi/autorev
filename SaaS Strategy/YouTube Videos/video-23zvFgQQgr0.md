## Transcript

well hello everyone I'm yuman sang I'm the CEO and co-founder of turn zero and Welcome to our webinar uh before I actually get into the webinar and announce my co-host a couple of sort of um a couple things to go over one this is being recorded uh and if you sign up for the webinar in fact if you're on this call uh you will get a link to this webinar to listen to later and share um we are going to be taking a lot of questions so this is a very popular webinar uh that we do every year uh live you have lots of questions we're going to try to actively uh answer questions as we go along so use the Q&A um the a feature in zoom and ask questions and we will try to answer them throughout the the call uh and you should by the way get an email um tomorrow afternoon with the link to the recording and the PDF of the slide all right let's go let's go to our next slide Corey is also in the background um and she will be moving the slides and helping us with our surveys but I do want to introduce my co-host Rob Belcher and Rob is by the way Rob this is the sixth year we're doing this is that right Rob amazing yeah it's great six year um and so and you'll hear us I wanted to jump in but I hadn't been introduced yet so but um you'll hear us yuman and I be very collaborative throughout this presentation and that's kind of what he's getting at with the questions is we've been doing this a long time uh it's it's always great there's always new data there's always new analysis there's new things to talk about but we'd love to hear your questions and incorporate them into the conversation too as much as you can on Zoom so well Rob tell us a little bit about yourself so let me just introduce SAS Capital just real quickly uh SAS Capital was founded in 2007 and we just discussed that in fact you actually named it it was named SAS capital in 2007 it's crazy yeah SAS just was brand new then um and you are one of the or providers and one of the leading providers of growth debt designed specifically for B2B SAS companies uh so that's what SAS Capital does Rob why you just talk about your role there and talk specifically about what that means is providing debt to SAS companies yeah so um SAS Capital we provide Capital to SAS companies we only are A lender we don't provide equity and uh we we provide mr-based credit facilities so it's a a line of credit that you can draw on and use to grow usually as an alternative to a small Equity round or something like that we do anywhere from $2 to $15 million into companies with 3 million of ARR and up uh like I said to you know um either replace or push off like a series A or B round further into the future we've been around since 2007 originally um in our current sort of structure since 2011 there are five operating Partners I'm a managing partner uh with the company been with with the business since 2014 uh we funded 130 some companies so far and we're on our fourth fund about to raise our fifth and um have been doing this webinar with yuman for like he said six years so as a lender we need to get paid back at the end of the day I mean Equity investors want to get paid back too but it's a totally different strategy right they're looking for the big home run and they want to not get paid back they want to have an acquisition and exit we exits are great um we we love that that's super successful a lot of our portfolio companies do use us to boost through to a good Milestone of 5 10 15 20 25 of ARR before exiting and so that happens also and we love that but the model is you can also just pay us back and go on about your way as a bootstrap company with no equity no debt and free free ownership um uh and so part of our underwriting what I'm getting at is getting paid back retention is huge in our underwriting you know um if if you're shedding customers and shedding Revenue that Revenue quality is what we're underwriting and that's what we're we're lending against and so we want to make sure that that Revenue will stick around and be there next year and the year after to pay us back and so retention is like one of the probably the most important thing in our underwriting and turn zero uh is a customer success management platform uh that's what they focus on and we love it it's our favorite one um and so I don't know if you wanted to say so so you know a lot of folks probably came in through our we we invited a lot of our Network to this webinar too so folks might not be familiar with turn zero I don't know if you want to share a few minutes yeah thank you for hosting again as always and thank you Corey for managing things always a great time uh so turn zero we are a customer success platform we also work with BB SAS companies uh and we focus on working with customer success teams uh our platform really focuses on making sure the customer is the customer experience is actually done right from onboarding generally to adoption uh then probably to a renewal and then to expansion reference and referral right you can imagine sort of the life cycle of just the road to a happy customer um you know we want to help our um customers manage that entire cycle um yeah there's a there's a slide there's a chart here later on I think we'll call back to this that we'll see the effects of that right as companies sort of grow through their phases and finally professionalize the Cs org a little bit and build in that life cycle you'll we may be able to see some of that data here um super important to us so yeah and so let's actually talk about it so um so and the folks over at SAS capit do an annual survey uh we'll talk about that survey um you know that's the most important thing we'll talk about some of you know what they find year after year and what they found most recently and I'm going to dig into something that sort of you know is happening now that's a little bit unusual um and that's around growth rates and Status valuations we'll talk a bit about that and then we'll open it up for Q&A um for for this audience as well all right so let's uh let's go on and so by the way so Rob why don't we talk about the survey uh and pamp it to you yeah so this is you know again we're lending to companies we like to know what is to be expected in the in the market what's a good median number of growth rate of retention of of spending so we did it originally for ourselves just to know but um it's been a really valuable thing I think for the market also and we love to share the results of the benchmarking survey so we run a survey we're on our 13th year uh we get around 1,500 respondents they're everything from pre-revenue or very very small to hundreds of millions of ARR uh just from our Network and what our our list looks like it's mostly us UK Canada uh focused but it is global we do get folks from all over the world responding um and for this survey we are focused on net and gross revenue retention uh again Revenue retention is number one for us your business you may focus on logos or customers or some other metric that's really important for your business and that's great that's fine um generally in the SAS Market Revenue retentions sort of a the good top of the the pyramid metric and we like to see the difference between net and gross uh and so the way we calculate those or we ask the respondents to calculate them and the way we do it in our covenants we have covenants around retention in fact is a cohort uh calculation year-over-year again this is uh I'll back up even a little bit more the survey is annual and we run it at the end of January early February when folks are closing out their books for the prior year so this is all on December or sorry on 2023 performance and so we just finished it we just closed it out and did all the analysis in March and here we are in April presenting so this is on 2023 data so as an example what was your Revenue in December 2022 total revenue what was it and then what was your revenue from just that customer cohort there were customers in December 2022 what did they do for you for Revenue in December of 23 full stop is net revenue retention just what did they do for you in Revenue if you take out any upsells cross sells price increases anything like that that's your gross revenue retention so the best you can do on gross revenue retention is 100% you can retain exactly 100% of what you did in December 2022 net revenue retention world's your oyer you can upsell you can cross sell infinitely so it can be more than 100% in fact often is um so Rob for for your business for your business you care about both net and gross and you don't really care about logo like you know that doesn't really matters so much to you yeah um we actually even did a blog post recently on the spread between gross and net because we think there's some interesting things to learn there that's not the topic for today you'll have to go read that yourself um but yes they're both interesting to us uh we've been moving our covenant to gross revenue retention over time because we think that's just it's more stable and it's a little more indicative of the true nature of the business net retention can have swings year to year as you did a marketing an internal customer marketing ini whatever it is right it can move around a little bit more so we've we've moved to gross but they're both very important and and very interesting as we'll see in the data here all right let's go to the data let's do it uh this is this is the core sort of base case here Baseline and this is net and gross revenue retention net is blue gross is green uh by ecv so we like we think segmenting retention by annual contract value that's what ACV stands for contract value or or you know uh average selling price or whatever um is the best way to look at retention because companies that have a certain sales price are organized similarly right you're you're organized very differently if you sell a a a low price like a less than TW you know $ thousand dollar a month thing is going to be very self-serviced you might not have much of a sales organization you might have a heavy support group right you're structured that way uh conversely if you sell a $500,000 uh contracts probably decent Siz sales org um a smaller support group right you probably got one CSM for you know one to five customers there or or maybe even more so um just you're organized the same based on what you're selling is our assumption there we look at it different ways and you'll see that here coming up but this is our starting point and what we've seen over time is uh the median gross revenue retention is 90 and the median net revenue retention Benchmark is 100 uh it's a little higher than that this year and particularly for the larger ecvs and that was sort of interesting um and then also you see a correlation here between gross revenue retention and uh ACV which has been the case for years and years and years net revenue retention has almost always been a steady Flatline across all acvs up until the last two three years and so we sort of Twisted ourselves around on making an explanation for that but I think this makes more intuitive sense you would expect both to sort of correlate with ACV I think um this feels more natural I don't know what was driving it before um but that's that's yeah I mean that was that that was a topic of conversation we had almost annually right where net revenue retention nrr was fairly consistent no matter you know what ACV you had um and this does feel more um more in tune with what I see out there and it makes sense right Rob like you know smaller companies probably don't have as much to give maybe there's not as much cross- selling maybe they're not as many business units you can tackle right to get the upsell um lots of reasons for doing that so this makes intuitive sense to me yeah now robob did you say that you this these numbers are up uh in 2023 yeah they're up a little bit you know these are small small numbers but um it again it was pretty um uh exacting at 90 and 100 over time and here I think the the median across all companies is more like 91 and 102 so it's not a huge increase but it's it's a notable considering how stable it had been for years and years it's up a little bit well let's talk about let's talk about that in fact I I I decided to add a slide um so let's go to the next slide Corey right um so this is the taale of SAS since 2020 uh all right so some explanation explanations U that's required one is this is the Blue Mountain is um mapping wcl which is an index fund uh of of SAS um public SAS companies so this would be like a docu sign or toast or Zora or OCTA right really specifically stas uh the red line is NASDAQ and that's generally the biggest Tech firms Microsoft uh uh Tesla Google whatnot and then the green is the S&P 500 which are the biggest companies uh but represent sort of you know the um the economy in general now and so this is 2022 if you move from left to right you see the first kind of dip that was covid right um and then something happens right something happens SAS really accelerates um uh through the end of 20122 just sort of way ahead of of NASDAQ way ahead of the S&P 500 and then it crashes and it crashes below uh the S&P 500 crashes below NASDAQ and now like it's hard to see right but you know NASDAQ and the S&P 500 the red and green lines they're at alltime they're near all-time highs they you know they kind of go up and down a little bit but you know if you take to the right that's actually fairly all-time highs again for those two whereas the SAS business is in fact half of what it was at the peak um so you know what when I talk to our customers a lot of them are suffering from this headache right of of um you know s taking a huge blow since 2022 do you see that uh among your portfolio companies and about to jump in the capital markets have shifted dramatically right um interest rates are way up and INE equity and m&a and IPO markets are way shut so um totally there they we're going to talk this is this is a great lead into a lot of the stuff and even at the retention things is growth rate is down companies are being careful about profitability we'll talk about all this in a minute and I think I think maybe where you're going with this I don't want to steal it from you is is focus on retention right there's a focus on profitability and retention and kind of keeping what we have strong and maybe growth is less there capital is not free anymore and so you know growth is less of a focus these days yeah you know I mean a lot when I talk to a lot of folks 2023 and even a little bit in 2024 you know when you talk about SAS there's a bit about bump bumping along the bottom right uh and so you can kind of see uh if you look once again at the Blue Mountain right we are kind of bumping along the bottom in fact why don't we do a quick poll uh so let's go to the next slide I want to ask the people on this call your experience okay this is your experience uh and I want to just do a comparison what Happ happened to your grr uh or nrr actually gr NR in 2023 versus 2022 so 2023 last last fiscal year last calendar year versus 2022 was it worse which means both your grr and RR dropped was it better was it mixed maybe one went up one went down right that can happen as well so let's go ahead and and um do that poll um and Corey has that up um and I don't know what's uh what's what's what's your guess going to happen with this poll I think I think retention has gone up a little bit for folks over the last year I think that's gonna be my guess but we'll see um interesting and I wanted to answer you asked about Capital markets too um interest rates basically went from zero to five and that and we lend money so our interest rates have gone up and so I assumed uh that our business would suffer and we'd slow down but the equity markets are so much more significantly impacted and shut that we've actually been just as busy if not a little busier than normal I'm a little surprised by that but it's you know the equity Market Equity has yeah Equity is really hard to get now right right and very few people are doing it and so it's not too surprising um you know oh look at that okay hey look at you right so 38% of you pretty mixed 2023 it's pretty mixed yeah pretty mixed you one by by a hair you know that's actually really interesting to me right um so if you take away the I don't know it is it's um it's it's fairly it's fairly interesting fairly fairly yeah fairly by the way I'm just going to make a bet if it's mixed okay I'm gonna say nrr dropped oh interesting yeah we don't have that but well I think we do in fact let's go ahead to the next slide I think we have that oh we have that for the I didn't meant for the poll but yeah that's that's great okay no not for the poll yes but for the slides let's take a SL and so this so you might ask this we we've been doing this forever and so we have all this data I it's like yeah great let's pull it together year over year over year to actually look at these and this is a pretty busy slide and there's two charts so there's a lot here I think the big takeaway so gross retentions on the left net retentions on the right and the the big thing I want to point out that there's sort of two or three big bullets on this and you can kind of ignore kind of blur your eyes a little bit and ignore sort of the detail detail is 2019 was very solid a good benchmarking year for retention for everything that was a good year for SAS things everybody was kind of mostly running on all cylinders so a good year for benchmarking and then you see 2020 in 2021 retention took a nose dive right in 2020 especially and then interestingly 2021 and two retention was at all-time highs from our from our survey um status from our survey data and I thought that was fascinating that you know you have this this quick burnoff of customers in 2020 and then a total entrenchment and a focus on um clamping down the house right and and retaining customers and retention shot way up and then this year down a little bit down generally across that's you know not perfect but across the board both gross and net were down a little bit so a little opposite of what everyone else was saying but um this is that's what that's what we're seeing compared to how great 2021 and 22 was from our attention standpoint and some of that's temporal you know exact cut offs on December you know and the market isn't like that you know September was the big drop September 21 was the big drop in valuations so so the one thing I want to ask you Rob is that you know grr on the left side um is fairly fairly stable right fairly stable but nrr on the right side is a little bit bumpier um and in fact you know what I hear from uh the folks uh that I work with is that they feel pretty good about gr for most part like you know like Hey we're hanging in there you know I mean like it's tough but we're hanging in there but nrr was oh nrr is tough um maybe we can talk about I mean one does that make sense to you in sort of a SAS downturn and if so what what do you think the Dynamics may be right for why and grr is staying relatively stable but nrr taking more of a hit well one thing that comes to mind that's a little bit related um was over the last two years a lot of our portfolio companies revisiting their contracts and reinstituting if they didn't have any inflation adjusters so you know we went through a period of 10 years of basically no inflation and then inflation got really high and so I don't know if that's showing up in the data but it's something that came into my mind when you're asking about bumpiness it's like oh well we need to start charging more because inflation's way up um because our salaries you know our wages are way up and everything um so that's one um we talked a little bit about it when we started that net retention does just move around you know you might do a big um promotion you might launch a new module one year um there's all kinds of things that can move net retention um gross retention you know who your top 10 customers are and you're going to bear hug them and and you know make sure they're really happy and and it's just that is kind of how how folks approach it right even even if you're a a vertical SAS company with you know 500 customers 50 of those are really important to you right yeah you know it's interesting what what we're seeing here is that gross revenue retention grr is has a lot to do with you know the quality of your product um you know how well your salese have sold you know good customers and the quality of your customer success teams whereas nrr has a lot of external factors right you know are your customers growing are they cutting back actually um you know are are their budgets being slashed um and so no matter how happy you're making them nrr could be just you know it's it it kind of feels more like new sales for many of our customers right so if new sales is having a hard time you know um the customer teams are having a hard time upselling so therefore nrr slips then I don't know if you were te that up but actually leads to the next slide pretty well um if we do want to go to the next one so this is you know we've been showing median data all the way through uh this actually gets sort of you know when we do survey data you want to know the top performers right or the worst performers and so kind of to Y Yan's point I think looking at gross retention on the left and net retention on the right gross retention is sort of the table Stakes of like what's the bottom of the barrel look like and I need to make sure that I'm better than that on Gross retention because like you said it's sort of the Baseline standard and net retention is the the lumpy uh again world is your oyster you can grow it as much as you want kind of a thing so it's more of like what what do the upper end of that look like so I like these two graphs as opposites like I I actually like to focus on what's the bottom cortile doing in gross revenue retention and let's make sure that our business is above 80% gross retention uh that seems like a nice Benchmark for sort of 75% and above and then on the net retention I like to look at sort of what are the best Achievers doing who's who's the most successful with net retention and what does that look like and so the top quartile there is you know 110 and up and for the larger acvs 115 closer to 120 like these are this is kind of an interesting comparison of the two metrics and like I said we you know we even did a an analysis of the spread between them and what that can tell you if you have only two or three percentage points between gross and net that's a really interesting Dynamic compared to a 30% spread right between them so so I'm I'm looking at that slide the gr slide on on the left and I'm looking at the rightmost um column right where if I am if I'm a company that sells the Enterprise and my gr is 100% I'm perfect I'm freaking perfect I'm only in the 75th percentile like there I'd probably argue that the 7 it's the 75th the 99th they're the same they're probably the same I got a C I just get a C+ right and I I got 100% I mean that is is actually kind of bananas um but you know I supp I mean those those guys are probably doing three or fiveyear contracts um you know they probably have 20 to 50 customers um I think it's not out of the question to assume any given year you might have 100% retention on I suppose I suppose if in fact you know those are the metrics right where you have a handful of customers that you really manage driving tons of money to you you got to keep them you got to just do almost everything you can um you know there is I I will point out there is a no never mind I take it back um I not that this is right youve got to keep them all yeah that's that's right yeah okay you the one thing I actually want to say which is um you know sometimes you hear about nrr being super high right like you know I think snowflake was at 150% 160% Zoom was up there and you know when that and by the way none of them are up there anymore right they're probably sort of back to sort of you know human you know sort of humanlike um numbers um but one of the things I would always caution people about and I want to sort of bring that back here does nrr your ability to actually drive nrr oftentimes is correlated to what kind of business model you have okay so let me just use a specific example um you know if you're a land and expand type of company where you're selling something really small at first just to close that deal quickly and then the idea is that over time like you know your customers buy more and more and more and more and more I mean that's an nrr friendly environment right whereas if you are you know selling something huge you know like a maybe a Erp system where you got to put it in and turn it on and do a big long implementation and people are buying something enormous up front uh your nrr is harder to do right so so maybe example is like a zoom right where it's like hey hey Rob why don't you and I just buy a license to zoom you know for our company uh and we can do that so that's the initial land and then pretty soon will you know add licenses for everybody in the company and that's the expand right your nrr is just automatically huge uh whereas if we were going to buy you know like a finance system we're just going to buy that once y right you know probably a like singular price contract like you said right it's not maybe it's a little bit extra for per seat but um you know it's $400,000 to buy it kind of a thing totally um yeah there's a double-edge sword there right and it's we've literally seen it with the zoom stock price is the slack in the zoom model is awesome for growth but it can it can evaporate too right that's the the flip side of it um and the downside to the nrr of the big Enterprise deal is you're locked in but um also you're locked in right it's it's probably not going to turn as much so it's important focus on your business model a couple of questions here from right the audience let me just get let me just get them by one some of them is about um a definition oh sure so in grr okay you said no expansions um uh no price increases no upsells how about down sells and cancellations ah yeah those count those count against you count yes so you add those in as a negative yes by the way grr is annoying as hell just annoying as hell you get all the downsides and none of the upsid this 100 here is such a surprise and interesting yeah yeah yeah anyway gr I love gr because I gr is actually as truthful as it gets okay like it lays everything bare but boy you you know you don't always get the credit you think well we've talked about this in the past another one we've seen some folks do that's even more critical is you only measure against contracts that are up for Renewal that period not your whole base also and so that might only be you know if you have some seasonality you might only have three customers that are renewing in a given month and so you could have like 25% retention that month so it's very critical um but it's an interesting if if it's better if you're kind of more normal throughout the year but um it's a it's a more critical one that's even more um dramatic I guess it can move around quite a bit but it's it's it's interesting all right let's move on couple more on these and then we've got a new topic on valuations and profits and stuff so let's yeah let's move through these um another uh you know we want to spread it on some other metrics so let's spread retention on ARR and see what retention does as companies grow and the big takeaway is that net retention is relatively flat as companies grow uh they sort of you know again I get I think it's Market product and business model related but gross retention like we said is sort of the hard truth and it tends to get worse as you grow and that's simply it gives customers more time to churn right when you're when you're very young they'll stick with you for two years and your first year retention is great and then after the second or third year that you might start seeing some turn or as you very common for our borrowers who are in that single- digigit million Revenue range they're intentionally allowing folks to to sough off that are no longer their ICP they've they've they started in one market and they've developed and they've grown and they're focusing on something else so they might want to intentionally let some folks go that are no longer a big focus of theirs so interesting to see the gross revenue retention decline to our our 90% median and then the the last Point here is that um for very large and this is what I was getting at with turn zero it's like you get to a certain scale and maybe even before that I think I think it's kind of the five really five million of ARR and up you need to start professionalizing your CS group and focusing on a lot of these things we're talking about in that customer Journey and you really see the rewards with these larger organizations here at least in the data but um I think that's that's sort of kind of how I would describe what's happening here you know a couple comments I would make Rob is when I talk to CS leaders um early on you know in in their uh life cycle the company life cycle they are really focused on nrr I like hey we need we need to really focus on nrr nrr nrr um and that's sometimes because grr is kind of in the bag right like you said for a year or two um and then you know when I talk to leaders when they're more mature they focus on grr um you know and this this chart seems to to to say exactly that right it's like hey you guess what you better start fixing your grr as you uh grow older um so you see that dip okay so let's say I'm I'm um you know I'm I'm a founder of a company is there is there any way I can avoid that Green Dip right over time right because that that's tough right like to lose you know you lose 5% of n of grr over time you know is that something that's avoidable you think I think it's really I mean you're starting you're starting a business from scratch you don't know if there's a market for it you know you hear about product Market fit I think it's unless so um you know maybe a really pure vertical SAS company where we and we see these sometimes the the founder is actually whatever that specialist was they were a veterinarian or they were an orthopedic surgeon and they started a SAS company and they know their Market really well maybe there's a chance there where they know the product and the market so well but almost everyone evolves and grows and explores their market and I think this is kind of inevitable and even 95% gross retention is phenomenal you know so yeah I think I think we should keep that in perspective that phenomenal it's phenomen 90% 90% is totally respectable and if you can keep that Benchmark that's that's really really a good solid business yeah you know I I I think you're right I think you know there are some things in life that you know will happen you know I remember when I started started my company you know I would tell people like these three things are going to happen right and they're going to feel dumb when it happens to you but there's no way you can stop it right like you know and and it'll be things like you close customers you just shouldn't close right because you're chasing growth it's like oh yes like nobody wants to like have a horrible customer but okay we'll close that horrible customer right and then of course it comes out you know the grr watch there so are we here the that customer got acquired it's not our fault all the time you know that that happens it's not your fault it happens it happens it happens yes yeah exactly uh all right oh the one we've talked about this in the past too the one is um our champion at the customer left and so they turned and we've talked about that is like you there are lots of strategies of avoiding that and things you can do to make sure that that doesn't happen if your Champion Lo leaves that you're still ingrained you still have connections you youve built your network that's really important so that's one it's not my fault the champion yeah that one is that one you need to yeah well I mean it's so it's that those are the worst words CS person Hears by the way right is you know everything's going great you're just you're just walking down the street and then you hear your Champion left and it just the rest of your day is ruined right yeah hate that all right we got two two more of these let's keep moving through these um this one this one another way to spread retention is on funding so bootstrap versus Equity let's focus on that slide or that chart first that's on the left here um interestingly that um bootstrap companies that split here which is actually different than history historically VC backed companies have been um better on both fronts and that's we think just they've got you know a big war chest to go spend certainly on the net revenue attention right they're going to focus on building more product building more features um you know cross- selling with other products and and exploring new new uh verticals and things um on the net retention you know again probably a more well funded CS group who knows uh interesting to see it flip here this maybe kind of goes with what we've been talking about the entrenchment and the the bearing down you know bootstrap companies often are entrepr entrepreneur Le sales and have good contacts at their customers and maybe keeping them um you know happier and focusing on uh their support and their success more these days I don't know um interesting to see but not uncommon to the Venture back companies slightly higher on the right side uh we have by horizontal versus vertical and also pretty intuitive but vertical F vertical companies that are focused on a specific thing be it dentist offices or veterinary clinics or whatever it might be hair salons tend to have better uh retention than their horizontal counterparts that are selling to all Industries a product that might be accounting software or HR an HR platform um is going to be a better or worse fit you know there's probably like a really nice core and then it gets a little fuzzier the further out from the core industry you get weaker retention all around so Rob vertical versus horizontal once again ver you know vertical is very specific to an industry horizontal you can sell to a lot of Industries as a debt person right you want to get your money paid back do you like a certain type of U software company I All My Children equally youa I know but come on just between all of us yeah vertical well vertical tends to have better retention and it's an important part of our underwriting so I would say our portfolio is probably 2third vertical one third horizontal that's a rough rough guess so is it okay would it would it be fair to say that the biggest companies in the world you know sort of you know the unicorns whatnot they're they tend to be probably more horizontal but sort of the sort of um more stable cash generating companies tend to be more vertical so horizontal big unicorn you you make a good point here which is I would say we sometimes turn down companies are going to be very successful they're probably burning more than we're okay you know more than we're comfortable with they're growing really fast maybe they're horizontal and it's not a fit for us but they're going to go on into exactly what you described they're going going to be a big success and they're going to be great and they're going to go huge okay uh our our lending box is fairly you know we we have our underwriting criteria and and so yeah there are certainly you know I think horizontal has generally slightly weaker retention but has more asymmetric upside bigger Market bigger Tam and can really explode so that's that's totally that's totally fair okay choose choose your choose your poison in that one got it yep all right uh okay our last slide on growth rate is this is kind of a fun one uh one or two years ago uh nick uh one of one of our our uh guys works with us flipped net revenue retention by growth rate which I thought was kind of fun and this slide kind of blew me away and there's only one takea away from this you could you can you can spend you can get the recording and dig into the numbers and all that all you want the one thing I want you to take away from this slide is that increasing your net revenue retention the x-axis the explanatory variable increases growth rate at an increasing rate there's a little you know it's a little fuzzy here in the middle between 100 120 you know it's not exactly but generally speaking this is sort of a parabolic growth as as you increase your net revenue retention you increase growth rate faster and faster and I think that's amazing uh and so you know maybe maybe the takeaway from the entire thing is net R net revenue retention is this sort of uh flywheel right growth you know it's interesting uh the so when I started in SAS um and I've told the story before but you know we would you know and I would raise money talk to a lot of investors um they didn't ask about retention until they've given you a term sheet and you're kind of doing due diligence and looking at bank accounts and making sure that you're not a fraud and they sort of casually ask your whatever attention it was right and sort of you know so it was a kind of a buried metric uh and then it sort of came up you like you know was probably a top five metric hey tell me about your growth rate tell me about your new bookings rate oh tell me about you know how your cash burn oh and tell me about your net revenue retention right it'll be like a top five I think it's a top one or two now Rob yeah yeah it tells tell me about your nrr yeah yeah it can tell you a lot about growth rate and retention you get a lot out of it I mean it makes sense right like you know the higher the NR are the happier your customers probably are the have your customers more likely you're going to grow your your new sales so yeah this makes a lot of sense to me uh the last bull here is let's keep moving yeah I'll just last last bullet quickly um that there's a relationship between 30% growth rate and 100% nrr if you want to be growing at 30% North you need to have according to this data nrr of at least 100% I that was a an interesting Benchmark just as we know filling the bucket is hard um all right so let's move through this um this is brand new research we haven't published it yet my partner Evan who's on the call actually and is making me very nervous about presenting this because he's the author um just recently published this uh it's some analysis around growth rate versus profitability as we discussed um SAS has gone through a bit of a roller coaster over the last five six years and even before that really um going all the way back to I'd say 2016 um you can see the dip in January of 2016 I remember it very well uh SAS valuations dropped precipitously uh and so this is some analysis on how the Market is treating growth versus profitability and how it did before and how it is now so quickly this is very similar to what yuman shared at the beginning uh we track our own it's not a tradable index like the whatever that was the rld DC or whatever the the index was you shared um that's tradeable right you can go buy that you can't I mean that's right you could go buy all of these shares individually but this is just a thing we compile called the SAS Capital index that we like to track as a median valuation multiple of companies that look and feel a lot like the companies we would lend to If Only They were smaller and not public you know they're they're sort of large and they're generally vertical U some are horizontal but there large you know Salesforce is in there adobe's in there um OCTA and Zora and toast are in there anyway so this first slide is sort of setting the stage the SAS Capital index the median valuation multiple of B2B SAS companies generally went through a period of multiple ex expansion through the 2010s like I said there was the dip in 2016 and then the rush to digital transformation in the co postco era evaluations went through the roof uh the SAS bubble and then they dropped significantly into this new regime where they've been around six or seven times ARR um and pretty flat moving sideways pretty steadily for two years it's been interesting so and we've we've heard both in the private markets and in the public markets growth profitability so let's look at it we can go to the next slide and this chart show let's focus on the blue line first the Blue Line shows the median growth rate of all SAS companies in the SAS Capital index over time for the last 14 years or so you kind of ignore the beginning you know SAS has grown a lot and there there there were only you know 20 some odd companies in the index a long time ago and then companies have ipoed until the index has become more robust over time so the beginning is a little noisy um but what's interesting is starting in about 20 sorry 2013 growth rates for public companies have just broadly been declining steadily um those are public companies right and so we've also heard about companies staying private for longer and not going public as early and so you know Salesforce went public with like I'm going to totally Butch of this but it's something shockingly low in terms of Revenue like I feel like it was like 10 million of AR or something like that it's that might be totally wrong I just remember being dramatically way smaller than you would think you know they they were only private for two years and then it went public and so that era is a little bit changed and so folks are going public when they're larger and they're not growing as fast so you're seeing some of that effect um as well as maybe just Market saturation I don't know exactly um with the bump obviously for Co the orange line is a little bit you got to wrap your head around this and the whole section is going to be a little data intensive so bear with me I'll try and describe it and also just try and tease out the key takeaways and we don't have to get into the regression analysis of everything but the orange line is the change in profitability so growth rate we're all very used to talking about which is the change in Revenue it's a little bit uh unique to try and make your brain think about the change in profitability not just what is profitability like what is my profit level but the change in profitability is these Orange Lines so generally and that's the left axis by the way and there's a zero line right about halfway there that you can see so again in 2013 companies were generally becoming less profitable but growing faster and generally then gradually increasing their profitability over time and then we went through the period of growth rates uh you know of trying to focus on growth and profitability was declining declining declining and then it switched dramatically in 2021 so companies have been changing their profitability and becoming more profitable drastically in the last year or two so that's this starts amazing I mean this I mean the the the roller coaster ride both on growth and profitability has been crazy since 2021 yeah yeah and the complete complete inverse the direct inverse is really interesting right it's wild all right so now we're going to get into some regression analysis bear with me and don't Focus too much on the chart and I'll just try and tease out the key takeaways so how does the market so blue dots blue dots are growth rate let's go back yeah there we go that one um so blue dots are growth rate and valuation multiple in the so we're leaving out the SAS bubble this all this analysis the following analysis leaves out the SAS bubble of 20 21 and two and just looks at the most recent period and the 10 years before so the 10 years before is blue and the current period is yellow and how is the market correlating growth with valuation multiples and the fascinating thing is today in today's market and in the old regime the market is generally correlating growth rates the same as it did in the old regime today so the yellow line is today Blue Line's the old regime and the slope is almost identical right the the market is basically saying for a given uh growth rate or a given an increase in growth rate I'll give you the same bump in valuation so that's that's what this takeway so that again don't get lost in the regression just know that growth rate is positively correlated with valuation and generally the market is rewarding the same increase in growth with the same valuation bulb next slide is profitability comparing that and interestingly the market is uh dinging you for profitability the more profitable you are the the lower your valuations it's negatively correlated profitability and uh valuation and fascinatingly in the before times and the current environment the market is dinging you the exact same amount if you if you increase profitability by 20% you can expect your valuation multiple to go down about the same um we could talk about the the in those lines like why it's shifted up a little bit that's sort of if we have time at the end we'll talk about that that's a whole another thing that's like two pages in the the the um the report but it's an interesting one too but for this purpose just know that it looks like the Market's rewarding growth and profitability the same and negatively for for profitability and positively for growth but let's look at the very last slide here and I know I'm going through this really fast there's going to be a full report on this that was just profitability and valuation but if we look at this is sort of the first derivative thing this is why it gets even more a little more complicated but if we look at the change in profitability today so for companies that are changing their profitability those are being pro um positively rewarded this is the yellow line here so not just what your profitability is but if you're actually moving year-over-year your profitability is increasing the more it's increasing the more you're being rewarded on a valuation standpoint than you were before in the the old regime increasing your probability actually decreased your it was still negatively correlated which is fascinating like you were you were incentivized not to to decrease profitability here if we do the first Der and we look at the change in profitability year-over-year those companies are actually being rewarded so all this is to say that um growth is still the most highly correlated uh metric on valuation multiples but increasingly increasing your profitability is having a dramatic impact on valuations and we're seeing that now so that's a super fast I wanted to leave us time for questions and stuff but that's a super fast look at some new research on profitability growth rates valuation well let me let me play that back for you Rob because I I think this is interesting and maybe we can talk about what it means for the folks on this webinar okay so you know oh I actually took calculus in in college and it was great to actually you know kind of reminds me of some of this stuff yeah all right so but basically you took out the SAS bubble right cu the math just didn't work okay the math broke the mod was broken right so over a long period of time the market likes high growth over low growth over a long period of time generally also over a long period of time the market seems to prefer companies that are burning that are burning money rather than making money but that's probably related to growth a little bit right Rob yeah okay exactly so but let just let's just say right you know you can't burn money forever but if you're burning money you're probably growing pretty well right but the one change that is happening and that's what this slide is saying is that the market is seeking companies that are converting to towards profitability now right and so for this period of time now uh post bubble right that's the yellow if your company is moving towards advancing towards profitability at a good clip you are getting rewarded for that in the marketplace with higher valuation y all right exactly okay and I think I you said you said a great thing is how what does that what does that mean for everybody on the call right and I think that's that's great and I think what that means is you know Equity markets are tight Capital markets are tight if you're thinking of going out and raising money you know improving your profitability is looking really good right now the public market the public investors are certainly focused on that so private investors probably are as well uh if you're looking for a new job right look for maybe a company that's improving profitability maybe not one that's accelerating burn so that's sort of how I would look at this is growth rate is still really important but we really are seeing in the empirical data that growth at all costs is over you know Capital markets are tight increasing your profitability is rewarded um you know if you can get a bit at all so I think so this the yellow line right um do you think this is a long-term Trend or do you think it's a temporary reaction or correction to the bubble I think you just asked me me how long are interest rates going to stay high is what you just asked me there you I think it's related I think if interest rates you know you've heard terms maybe I I follow Jerome Powell the the chair of the FED um hire for longer is a common term right now is our rates going to stay higher for longer are they going to cut at the end of the year you know I think a lot of these things will drive it and folks are hedging and getting profitable um you know people say that the rates we're seeing now interest rates we're seeing now in the economic and the capital markets we're seeing today are the normal the capital markets and the interest rates we had in the 2010s were the abnormal right that was the the uh rare thing that's never happened before zero interest rates right and so is this the new yeah like growth all costs burning cash raising money um yeah more stable I think it's I think it's going to stick around I keep pushing it out um but now I think this current environment is at least 18 to 24 months longer okay so if you believe Rob and I do um you know we're we're not going to go back to the 0% interest rate we're not going to go back to the bubble right because bubbles do happen when weird things happen like a 0% interest rate so we're not going to get back there and so if you are an invest you well if you I I'll actually talk to the Cs folks on the on on the webinar if you're a CS person guess what uh it's there's going to be a good focus on you and your colleagues right to keep your customers um to stabilize the customer base uh and to drive profitable uh incremental Revenue right people want profitable growth now and guess what's a great way to get some profitable growth is is actually through good nrr uh so I think that's super important Um well hey let's uh okay so let's do some Q&A please uh throw some questions into the Q&A oh actually no let's do that one more survey sry let's forget about that let's look um all right so how's grr nrr going so far for you in 2024 right so this the first first quarter uh of 2024 let's throw up the survey how is grr nrr going for you so far in 20124 so let's throw up that survey I don't know if it's up Corey I don't see it there it is okay um so you know basically same right is it going worse uh both gr and are dropping is it better uh this is compared to 2023 of course right so how's it going year to date so far um by the way Rob there's a lot of questions about s of the data a lot of questions about you know stepping into the data are these reports available where where can people go to get your reports and sort of dig into the data if they want to yeah good good point um sasy capital.com is our website and all of this is free it's all there if you're on the webinar you've probably already given us your email address that's the only thing for the downloads usually you have to throw in an email address and then you can get the downloads so any of these things some of this isn't even up yet though this is fresh hot off the press uh so you're getting it before it's public um and hopefully some of you like I said at the beginning are are respondents to the survey and you got the the results already so thank you for your participation uh we wouldn't have this data without you it's completely Anonymous it's completely private we aggregate it we don't ever like separate out individual companies uh and so it's we take that privacy very seriously so that we can do stuff like this so thank you and great I'm just like looking through the questions first off awesome questions um thank you for for all your attention look at that you see um the poll results yeah okay you so far so far awesome yeah it's doing better 2024 is doing better that's great uh I'm gonna say green shoots okay green shoots um you know that uh it's it's it's looking better U all right so here's a question I I'll ask of you um this is from Julio as a lender Rob do you how do you view today growth versus profitability making your leing decisions like you know how do you measure both against each other that's a great question um I would say our underwriting has not changed much you know we're again we're A lender and so we're looking at how can we get paid back we're not looking at how big can this company get and how what can the exit be and who's the potential acquirer we're just looking at is this a stable company so my my answer to that is our underwriting is not not changed much like I said we've focused on grr more than nrr now that's a change but growth versus profitability are still about the same so again we're lender we don't require you to be growing at 100% a year our minimum is about 10% uh growth rate and profitability is simply driven by Runway um and so a quick metric for you if anybody is interested um we lend you usually around four to eight times monthly revenue and so and we like to see you have at least a Year's worth of Runway so if you know we're lending you six times Mr if your burn is more than 50% of your Revenue you don't have a Year's worth of of Runway if that makes sense so so our our general rule of thumb is if burn is 50% or less of Revenue we can probably make it work if it's higher than that it's probably going to need some other lender or Equity or something like that okay yeah that makes sense to me all right um I got a question this may be something uh some something when I can answer basically I'm I'm going to rephrase it a little bit uh this this person they sell to smbs through a reseller okay and they don't feel like they have Direct Control of grr right you know because the reseller is managing the SMB business um you know does is grr still an effective measure in that case um yes absolutely right I mean it's still a big part of your business you're clearly investing in it um I think it's important to actually segment also maybe the the really the answer for you is to segment your different types of customers depending on maybe how big they are or you know how you got them you know in this case a reseller you know and and measure measure the different segments differently you know at least in you know against themselves and then you focus on Improvement right you focus on grr improvement nrr improvement because it may be bad right uh because you don't have Direct Control you don't feel like you have any control but doesn't mean you can't you know work with your partners to make it better so would say um uh make sure you uh maybe segment and and and work on each uh each part really hard I got a question for you rob okay so someone is luckily moving towards an IPO yeah I saw this question I wanted to talk about this this is great okay yeah okay so they're um they're operating under the concept of rule of 60 um so maybe explain the let me quickly explain the rule do the rule 40 yeah so rule of 40 is basically you take um a growth and you take earnings uh and then add them together right sometimes it could be positive and negative number but let's just say you're growing 20% and you're making uh 20% um um profit margin right 20 plus 20 is 40 anything above 40 is considered a very healthy company okay I think it was it was originally coined by a PE investor who said I'd only invest in a company that's 40 or better 40 or better 40 or better yes 40 or better and you know and you can do it either way right you can have have huge growth and burning a lot of money you can be 40 you can have you could be making a lot of money 40% e and growing zero you still look rule of 40 right so it's actually really convenient okay so this um person is trying for rule of 60 and growth accounting for 20% and making 40% uh margins uh you know should they be growing more like will they should they be making less money or growing more to get a better valuation what do you think that's a great so there's a couple points here one is there was recently some talk about the rule of X and changing the rule of 40 to be a little more malleable and relevant to the scale of a business this person was a private Equity investor coin this term was looking at large companies that were more stable more profitable and it wasn't necessarily as good a metric to apply to a fast growing scaling company uh so I think the rule of 60 is fascinating I think that's great I applaud this person for looking at something a little different and focusing on it and trying to be best to breed uh I think to answer the actual question is like what what should your metrics be we'll we'll provide some growth rate benchmarks coming soon um and some spending benchmarks coming soon so you'll be able to compare yourself to companies of similar size it has to it depends on what size you are that's the the thing is like 20% growth for a $2 million company is not really impressive but 20% growth and profitable for $100 million company is is great um our also on our website is the data that builds the public all that public company SAS Capital index data and so it has revenue and it has profit it's um it's operating income is the number we grab on the profit side so you can go in there for all 90 companies that are in the index and go find somebody that's the same size as you see what their and it has their valuation multiple you can see what their valuation multiples look like so there's all kinds of comp data in there um it's great and the last comment on IPOs is equity markets are pretty shut right now I think there's probably a tsunami of equity deals to be had at some point I don't know what the trigger is you know higher for longer on rates and all this stuff but at some point IPOs are going to start and it's going to be this trickle down not even it's this flood all the way down of the equity markets opening back up so applaud to you on iping good luck with it um we'll put in the sci when you when you're public We'll add you to the index and uh uh yeah good question all right wow we are out of time and we have we had a ton of questions left there's some great questions in here I'll try and get through them um and answer them I don't know how we'll do it if we can send them yeah I think we we can do a blog post uh after the fact answering some of these questions uh all right well Rob once again six the six annual uh SAS Capital uh survey webinar is over thank you everyone for joining us once again we will be we have been recording this and you will get a link to this tomorrow as long uh along with the slides Rob thank you again we'll we'll see you next year yes always always a pleasure thank you talk to you thanks everyone bye bye.
