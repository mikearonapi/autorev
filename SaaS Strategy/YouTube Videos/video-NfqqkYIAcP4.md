the more I do SEO the more I become believer in brand awareness and branding if I was going back in my steps as an SEO I will focus more on breathing brand awareness than other kind of [Music] content hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the S show I'm your host George Cotes and today I'm very happy and excited to be joined by Nick MOS for the past seven years Nick has been a part of the learn WS team and as the first marketing p in a fast growing startup he has helped grow the company from less than 5,000 organic sessions to 1 million sessions uh Nick is a friend and a person I really value in this industry so it's a really pleasure Nick welcome happy to be George uh I I want to to say something more about the the scripture I have also been everywhere I have been doing growth marketing for LW so I have been in most positions have been done sales which is my stated job and but I have done everything that needs to grow a company from product releases to email marketing PPC almost everything that you can imagine probably other than outb on sales sales is good though uh it's tough but it's good because you you are in the like in the front line like you you you get to hear the objections uh the pain points the challenges everything right yes sales has actually our first SEO strategies because listening to the voice of the customer is important it's an uncomfortable position but the insights for sales is the most important as long as you filter the right ones because sales will give you only the higher valued corporate customers and not the the lowest customers and when you need everyone you have to understand discrepan in data so sales gives you incredible insights I agree with you um so let's start um let's start here what did you do before learn ws and how did you end up um being the the first marketing high at learnes so the story goes that the LA the last few jobs before Le Works were educational based so I was the website manager about an educational website doing mostly local news and I was managing the website learning some SEO Basics then I was looking to H sorry then before that I was also the marketeer in a in a college here so I was in the marketing department doing both physical and digital marketing and then I decided that I want to leave Cyprus I was thinking to try London I had a friend I was crashing to his couch for three months and I found a a part-time job that was Cyprus salary for land which like I did something like five times more salary to figure it out but this company was moving from Cyprus to London and was willing to have an account manager to help them with the move that is here being trained and going through uh their Atlanta the job didn't hold much so was difficult for the company to find SEO clients but I was learning the basis of uh managing some writers some leag Builders some outreaches and uh and clients to get them to get them leags so it was a very quick uh learning about the steps in to SEO at the same time I was looking for a job in London I didn't like the culture them I left and I ended up on January 2017 having two offers one was in London in into an NGO for a marketing position theal marketing position and the other was back in cus uh for larts as the first marketing hire and it was more exciting to be in lews how many do you remember how many people uh were in lws back when you joined it was the three founders and I was the fourth and higher there were two part-time out sers that were working occasionally one for servers and one for uh um for design but essentially after the three developers one we de to developers I was the the next higher okay that's interesting I thought you joined uh later um okay I know what learn WS uh di I join at the 170 customers were many thousands so I was almost the S marketer almost a thousand customer I think we H the SE person a little bit before okay that's interesting so you've seen the the whole thing from its sort of inception um yes I'm the first I know what uh learn wol does or do depending on how you you uh you use the English language but for people who who don't know uh can you please um give us you know a very quick overview of uh what LOLs does and who is the typical customer and gets the most value out of the product yeah it's happy now that most people know what we're doing because a few years back back then it was not so popular where a course platform and as a course platform we give a system a software system that someone can create market and sell their courses uh it's a little bit more than that more complex because we serve a lot of cases so our customers usually send courses but they might be also training their customers like a B2B trainers or they might be doing internal employee training so it's a m a lot of cases uh but the essential is n course platform create markeet and selling horses is our essential use cases for our customers and we serve anywhere from creators to medium and big businesses okay that's a tough Market to meket it's of T yeah um okay so you have seven seven years plus in the company um what would you say are the biggest most important learnings when it comes to growth and marketing from your experience so far I will Cy on growth and marketing and tell you also our managers challenge because I seen them for Mar close it's every growth stage is different like what I was doing the first year is much different that what I'm doing now every stage in between is different like the first time you're trying growth hacks the second time the second growth stage you might be try to find a new growth hack or you might need to be more strategic then you have multiple challenge you don't have one two three you have multiple EV every time you have to reent in different stage and things that were working a few years back or were working on different stages do not to really work on the next ones and you have to adapt and you have to adapt building a team around managing a team collaborating with another team is different to be Sono versus having a small team a big team departments managers people below it um it changes okay and what about uh challenges um what would you say were and maybe are the biggest challenges working at a fast growing SAS company it's finding the next step to grow like there is no time that you should stop being adaptable and you should not pursue grow um having to have in mind that it's not like another command that would might have a brand awareness met you always have your eyesight on uh Revenue goals on half metrics and you have to be realistic you have to be attributable which also attribution is a challenge it was a challenge software came up to solve it and now we have other challenges like Hogie blockers and different Technologies so attribution has be a problem and it will be a bigger problem in the future as well oh what are your thoughts on attribution uh and like in general measuring um the performance and evaluating the effectiveness or measuring the effectiveness of your efforts um because there is a lot of uh chatter about attribution online and some SAS companies um lately um basically say that they have fixed the attribution um problem but I would like to hear your thoughts when it comes to attribution um what do you think or what you have seen uh work it's like my two bra brain hemispheres fighting because so you have to understand that SEO is being requested to be more attributable I'm I was always very harsh on myself and always measuring Reven as my main metric my main goal and that's at the first touch however especially on longer sales Cycles it's much more difficult to ATT to something think that one example right now we have customers that are coming with three emails you might have an account executive coming in because the manager requested it and then they have the it approving s the software and then the accountant comes in creates an account and purchase this is a very weird unusual and difficult journey to monitor but it happens more more often than you can imagine also someone coming from a Gmail and then purchasing from business account or the other way around it's not easy to attribute you have to understand how to attribute and how much you can accept that you cannot and the you have to trust the ability Sometimes the best marketers trust their guts and like I I love what the rat fish fish tick is is doing and no attribution going full brand the same things that what H was doing the first years they were not looking for attribution they building their brand a strong product and they were growing this can happen still now attribution is not everything but you need attribution to convince management and convince investors and convince everyone to give you the budget continue so you have to play this game of p on the numbers but also understand that not everything can be measured and have the right expectations and also some sideways of understanding like uh brand spikes uh to understand when an activity is bringing results in a in a more attributable way do you think that when it comes to SEO um and organic search things are a bit more straightforward can you like attribute um or assign value let's say to SEO initiatives um easier um than say podcasting or I don't know other initiatives like um Fu sales or whatever compared to presly see bands and and uh and podcast yes but easy it's not one way for example you don't want to measure Revenue you can discuss with your performance thing because performance is the best friend of SEO and they should be also your best friends you you can count the keywords the traffic you are getting based on how much you have paid for uh performers to get the keyword think that if you are getting 10,000 searches if this is a valuable keyword because it might not be valuable would you pay 5,000 10,000 $100,000 in advertising Li get those and would you pay it would be Target for this keyword so this is also a side metric you you can find different ways to attribute whether it's direct signups lit capsules clicks uh there are many ways and Depends different combin on different metrics it's easier but it's not the easiest way okay I see and as fun have in mind that Google is releasing pmax the same pay for SEO it will it will be passed over to Performance PMX means that they don't know what keyboard they can get they're just paying and they're getting results they can measure the result but they don't know what their target it's a pain I mean it's it's getting tougher and tougher and it's like it's as if these these platforms created the need to be present on their platform but now it's as if they say that you know what moving forward you have to pay in order to be to be present on on my platform or pay more because in in paid searches uh case you have to pay more right or in in in organic search um it's you will get less and less and less but I expect more uh from you I I expect originality I expect perspectives I expect different uh content formats but keep in mind that I will send like I will I will send less traffic your way and I'm like okay what's the incentive then why why should I invest in paid search or and why should I invest in organic search I don't know what your thoughts are but uh it's kind of like a dead end right um I read an opinion which was which make a lot of sense that Google doesn't want to kill you as a publisher because many of the pishers that are getting the traffic are sending money back to Google like close to 30% I think they use adws to Monet adets to monetize their content so even from those visits they get money and then do do not want to kill the people who are bringing the money aka the SAS businesses the other businesses Enterprises everything so they will continue to send you uh the people but they have a monopoly and they want their money to make their investors happy as you want your Founders investors CEOs to be happy yeah uh likely no seos for me but I don't know about the future right um so Nick next thing I would like to ask you is uh regarding your SEO strategy um if I I would ask you to like summarize um learn W's SEO strategy what would you you say uh that strategic is and what you know is it what does it includes and what are the main pillars and and so on okay without everything but I will give you the main pillar of my strategy is bringing the right people at the right moment to bring the results we want what it means I will give you an example of a competitor I have been seen falling down through HS at least over the past few months this competitor has been targeting top of the funnel keywords and the and this and another they showing for something like uh you YouTube U CPM which I would like to Target as well it has a lot of traffic but it's not a high priority for me they're not going to get the customer adult there they might get traffic they might see a value graph on HS they might see traffic on their website growing it's a high volume keyword and there have a lot of this high volume but at the end my SEO strategy is not to bring 5 million people I want to bring a thousand people that will purchase so you you have to understand I'm I'm always looking for the content that will bring the right people at the right moment and I'm focusing a little bit more about on the funnel purchasing them but also in mdle of the funnel that it's relevant I'm not going for example to write for an Ming platform how how to sell dog cookies it's it's not relevant I'm not writing out out of it might seem obvious but there's so many SOS out there that just check volumes and they think that volume is their number one metric and bringing a lot of people and probably I'm moving forward conversation but this is the problem of programmatic advertis sorry programmatic uh SEO and this is why we didn't do programmatic SEO because I can write 1,000 articles no quality articles but first of all I don't want to I have a very high quality website and I want to throw it and secondly if I bring 5 million people in a shitty AI generated page they will not purchase they will not download an ebook they will not go get a trial that's no value people I would be happy for 5 million visits but I'm not selling addtions I'm selling a software I want quanity visits and this is the heart of my strategy every time I have to ask this question what's the business B the Comm and this drives every other DC that's a good point because I think that with AI many people are missing the point which is that every piece of colon has to serve a certain objective right if you can somehow uh like meet the objective or objectives that you said with the use of AI okay you can do that but as you said like your your goal as a SAS company particularly especially is to sell right to sell like whatever that may be because people are in different stages um it's not just to like speed out thousands of pages and do it just for the sake of it because what's the business impact this action will have right yeah see think that letter Wars has a little over 400 blog pages and because we have many landing pages for campaigns I don't remember now now the website but the website has less than 200 Pages maybe with some generated some other ones maybe it's more maybe it's 2,700 pages I was doing a screaming from report earlier I don't remember the number but it's very small so the there is no you see that you will were targeted you don't need to write about everyone you should not write about everyone you should write for the right people that will grow your business and this is what many seos are missing and this is what many people are just selling empty promises people they don't know how deliver them yeah uh unfortunately um now you mentioned competition and you compete you and other uh SAS companies in other categories uh compete against of course um other players in that same category but also affiliate websites review sites uh blogs and so on um and in many cases you could compete against all these you know websites um for terms with commercial search intent right important terms for you my question is how have you managed to hold maintain high ranking positions um over the years considering that competition if anything gets tougher and tougher actually you're touching one of my favorite topics because I really love to out compete Affiliates and I'm I'm pretty sure that our partnership team does not share this sentiment with me because as the First Market here I care about the the company's bottom line paying that click to an affiliate instead of getting yourself is a Mis opportunity like and this is the value that I cannot attribute if you know how to attribute it just send me a a PM and let me know how to do it because you cannot imagine how much money we are saving just by out competing affiliates uh in the end they might catch up the traffic as well but still if you're paying 30% out of Affiliates it's a huge amount forever that you're Pay customer and the C per customer is crazy one with SEO is meaning so but how do I I compe I am a long-term person here uh many of the articles that you see out competing on lews they're not recent they are four five years old so they are early bets that work and those early bet early bets were huge mystical huge how articles guides that they keep aing uh I keep as much as possible as much capacity allows the content fresh that means updates that means um checking out what were missing and every time improving and to be honest some of these pieces might they might need to be updated twice a year even Min minor updates just to keep the position but usually good guides good quality content long form content and listicles tend to attract leaks and they tend to attract natural leaks this is the best way to do link building unfortunately that's very slow I had the advantage of doing this for years H so if you come here you T to can out compi me you might need to spend anywhere between 10 to 20,000 k for each page and it doesn't ensure that you are you are going to out convi me uh so yes high quality cond regular updates keeping design and other elements media also updated for example in some of the best my best pieces have changed cover images three times I prefer to avoid touching the cover pages except needed and also adding media video that is still relevant and some sometimes changing it because it needs to be refreshed eding embedding videos uh we have a design and well the next updates you will see that we have a redesigned C conent PRS zones that they are visually more appealing they make it the after more scrollable more easily readable there are buttons to some articles to test that if buttons sending to other Pages even competitor sometimes is this okay is it a good practice we are always updating and improving an itating just to keep one step ahead of the competition and right now yes it's very difficult to out comete G2 or Forbes or some other big sites even zapper is getting into this game and it's almost impossible to out compe like I'm I'm out competing Force for I think a couple of Articles couple of topics of keywords and that's all I can do they are beating me in everything else Authority is not easy beat and I have developed good authority not as good as forbs my name is is right now but better than one than our Affiliates and you can see that Affiliates are actually moving out of the game and going to Performance as well why because SEO has become more difficult because huge players like hpot zap fors Amazon they are going into the content game and they are going to the affiliate game so the first three to five results in many valued high value keywords are incredibly difficult to compete for okay you mentioned vid and I would like to hear your thoughts on VD Oro video for me is the protection for SG I don't worry about SG I worry about our D awakeness in relation to SG and general but I'm will not I'm not woring SG will destroy SEO will take more than 5 10% of searches not even that much or not send any traffic because at the end they need to send it someone uh the video is what will save you from FG from SG if you are worried about Google rolling it out next year but it's also a new format that you need to catch up because many think that Tik Tok is becoming the search engine of the Young Generation YouTube is the second biggest search engy maybe Tik Tok now is the third or the second you need video there V is also shown in searches that um the new features that Google is releasing the perspectives they show more prevalence on video and then on communities so answering the same questions from your text content in video format allows you to open up another organic Channel I will not say exactly it's SEO or it's search or it's social or it's uh organic it's all of these are a new channel that we name later but video is not a future because text will never die but it'sing and you need to invest more in video if you want to be do you think though that V is something that com us companies or you know any any kind of company for that matter can Outsource or is it something that it's both ourselves and our competitors have failed in video because it's not consistent in longterm they can Outsource if it's a longer partnership with a trusted partner um you can Outsource part of the video but you need the phase to be in them you cannot Outsource the face and the voice everything else can be outsourced and there even a tools that if you don't I I know you're not a very huge B of AI but we can take this you can take tools like sesia and record your CEO or a couple of other people in the company and create them as the heads of every video and just Outsource script writing editing ideation just parts that are heavy in uh in production and you cannot hire people just for these if if you need five Specialties and you cannot have hire five people you can hire one or two you can Outsource yeah Al you mentioned uh when you when you mentioned SG you also mentioned branding uh or brand implications that um there may be there can you please elaborate on that um so how does llm works for me this is hugely speculative so an nlm cross the web so the chat the either the SG or Bing or whatever is a mixture or is the average of its experiences its experiences consist of reading the whole web which means if I'm looking for the best marketing platform it might be hopspot because everyone knows hpot because everyone in every listic call every review everywhere mentions hpot at some point so many times compare that with not exactly correct let's say zoko CRM which is a smaller competitor not exactly the same space but zoko is less known is mostly know Arabic countries etc etc etc May probably 100 times more than HSB IM that SG will probably show the top 10 results based on the most popular in words of math references on the web how do you have Word of Mouth you have a high brand uh awareness how you have high brand awareness people are using your product and they're mentioning you and as more think about again about Affiliates Affiliates love to promote companies that they know about and they're high in brand awareness because brand awareness they know gets them higher conversions from a visitor to a click to a customer to the uh to that software which means more money so if you have high blood awareness you have more people mentioning you whether it's ainat bloggers anyone else and also people sourcing your articles that they sourced for their articles this all creates more mens for you in the web which makes it stronger in the knowledge base of the machine machine learning algorithms who show up doesn't mean that this is the main criteria doesn't mean that the top 10 in Branda we will be the top 10 in SG but probably most of the sports will be oh working on brand awareness and having people mentioning you online will be a good way to get into SG results and that's an opinion we'll see the final implementation of SG how it is and will more in the next one years but is this brand building is it digital PR is it uh you know uh the the old good link building or how would you uh how would you label it I consider myself ano and a growth marketer and the more I'm learning about PR which was my second intership I hated it as a as a discipline not a company I was uh I am a bigger believer on public relations and branding activities it's not one thing it's uh it's a lot of things combine you cannot identify it as one thing um for SGS it will be people mesing around on their websites on their social or their blogs whenever SG craws and gets date which it's not digital PR but digital PR will be a part of it is more brand awareness I not sure if this uh this AIS are cing social media but let's say giving out swag to your customers and having them repost Ing and sharing you and tanging you all the time this might be a way to for an llm to understand that you are uh relevant and you have high band awareness for me it would be more possible to have more reviews more people mentioning you thousands of results thousand of pages so getting into the training this that that makes sense but of course this comes back to Concepts like topical Authority and like you know and of course uh principles that um will will will never stop exist like the fact that you have to provide people with a great customer service and and you know build great products and and embrace uh word of mouth and so on but the problem with SG is the incentive right you mentioned that you don't think that the the impact will be as significant um the problem I see here first of all I I also think that the the impact uh we we will see that's that's what I can say at this point we don't know how big the impact will will be right um but the problem is a general tendency towards keeping you know people on the the search engine and not sending traffic you know to to to websites Public Service SAS companies like learn worlds and so on do you see that as a general threat or like u a change that marketers have to do something about it's a minor because that means that they have to chaping out of the fun easy to copy C but they have to s the power like SG will not solve your problem if you are trying to create a course for us so even if they are if they they resp the questions how to create a Course and there the SG gives them one two three five steps the last step will be you have to create your material and you have to upload it somewhere and then you have to sell it this is our solution they cannot give them solution if thei was so Advanced to go to that level I would not worry about my job I would be worrying about my Universal basic income and my cocktail yeah which you know who knows we may get there uh one day Google may see Trends and may build tools and have ai agents build tools automatically or not automatically but you know build tools based on search strengths uh just so people can in fact like upload their course somewhere and you know classroom which is not exactly competitor by the way to your point I saw we we prepare uh and maybe I shouldn't give it away but going out I guess earlier than this episode uh will will be live uh we may we you know work on a new note for growth waves and the note is about uh Arc which is you know a product uh a browser product by the browser company okay and one of use cases we saw there from a person a user of Arc um who shared that on Twitter was that he actually built a course right on on his uh browser okay now imagine that right and he saided that course with either uh his team or like some people who wanted to take the course I can't recall but imagine if Google is a able to like identify these Trends because you know this is where people search um and then build Solutions like in a very simplistic form calculator you know or weather with I have done a calculator on jbt and I'm not a developer and it's terrible and it's Banky and so I have seen a lot of companies like SRA Sr this Academy it has their own software as their own course C they created a their course that Academy only custom the same as shs their courses are on cust they don't use us or our competitors there are many people so this is not something that scared me because exists because someone can do it doesn't mean enough people that knowledgeable most people want safety and that's what software gives you software subscription s gives you safety non buy support uh they built around an ecosystem it's a lot of things that canot offer that's why I'm not personally I don't know about our Founders there yeah yeah and you shouldn't um except except with uh except for content with SEO uh in mind what other formats you you mentioned video but what other formats um you see being more um prominent I interested to give you a correction from before yeah of course so I'm I mentioned about branding and growth marketing I I think so my two Specialties I will give you this perspective the more I do SEO the more I become a believer in brand awareness and branding if I was going back in my steps as an SEO I would focus more on building brand awareness than other kind of content and as a growth marketer I don't believe that growth marketing it's it's its own discipline growth marketing is doing marketing well which means every it's not something that every Market should do it just faster more iterations and more measure that that's the difference it's good marketing with more attribution and you are willing to do more experiments and pivot faster that's all H so I'm going there because the basis of marketing is are still here and most of things you see around are just good marketers branding different tactics in a different way and it it was there from beginning most of the very few things in the world are new are new were born from zero most of the things are based on something before and because I wrote a piece about AI on my research to write it and for a while it was the first about AI in education AI started on the 50s before actually I don't remember if it was 19949 or 90 1950 51 that was the first paper published so AI is not even M it just more usable yeah just that for a parenthesis and then you're asking yeah yeah so my question was regarding other con formats besides uh you know text based content or text based content but you know other formats besides you know that go beyond the blog and also be on video that we already covered a bit one thing that I'm working right now and we're exploring here at lorts is tools uh there is a lot of this low quality for me tools based on AI I'm not talking about this you men calculators and the template generators maybe it's a certificate generator maybe it's a PDF generator things that even AI can do I did a PDF recently with AI it was terrible uh from spreadsheets to quizzes to things that people can use these tools are incredible for SEO they are also saturated so you need to find the right ones that will work based on your brand based on your targets and work for your customers the tools is an incedible for M to work it's challenging but it's not as as challenging as people see for something for something like you mentioned certificates let's say you wanted to build a a three certificate generator okay see and you also had some templates that are let's say more premium and only people with a PID account can like use and enjoy okay would you do that or let me rephrase to do it would you use like a or R do keyword research see that people are actually looking for it or you would just go on and build it because you know from your customers and like General audience that this is something that they would actually use and they you know ask for but I love hry I love H for keyboard reset and I will go there and I will do it and there are other things like the keyboard Shater that to brainstorm about the tools uh but the thing is you you also need to listen to your customer uh we have cision about zero keyword H zero volume ke keywords you have to take these bets sometimes sometimes not uh there is M experience can tell you when you have to take this bets or not um so yes uh the first tools I would be using is based on keyword research the second layer if this the first words is that also what my cousins want and the most powerful tool we forget all the time I have the power of Google Search Eng unfortunately 16 months only a search console the if I go to the console I can see what CES accidentally On Tools I rank I will search there I will find and see the data there what is ranking why it's ranking and is it close to what I want and I have historical data if you're not a new startup right now and you're in a company that was uh is here for five 10 years you have data use your data to take decisions don't use data that is speculated because as much as I love the tools we mentioned they are speculated dat I have real dat even Google search conso is speculative up to a point it sides a of information I'm not I cannot take the 100% to account yeah and there sounding data like gole analytics Google sech console has its own limitations speaking of which I would like to ask how do you uh measure uh content performance um and how do you separate the signal from the noise when it comes to um which metrics to to take into account and which metrics are just vanity and you shouldn't pay attention to them uh why like measure traffic for me it's a van metric it's or leing indicator depending how you can consider it it's good to have an idea because traffic can give you quickly the results but I don't Focus my main metrics are uh trials or other commands called them signups so it's mid of the fun and revenue directly so my North Star is the revenue and then everything else is secondary and then I try to avoid either Impressions or the search conso or even clicks as a real metric and worst of all Dr or da like that's not even a met for me and just I don't know that okay but is isn't that a bit restrictive uh in the sense of I mean when it comes to okay even SEO I mean not everything is going to to be um it's going to be a a revenue generator right but how can you how can you sell in a project internal results of the channel in based I care about traffic and people busy and people reading the blogs when I'm creating topical Authority and relev content the total channel has to Contin continuously grow on devenue so it's not not about counting one article about this Rue it's about a c channel as a Cod because if I don't count the c channel then I forget to nurture the whole Channel I just nurture one up okay that that makes sense um I would like to shift gears a bit and as we are uh nearing the end of this episode ask you about um even though we we kind of touched on on it but from the search uh experience standpoint I would like to ask your thoughts on generative Ai and whether you have found any like practical applications of it for your role um any good use cases that you can share with us I started using one in the beginning and we have been using for example Jasper from last year early last year and we're using less now and but I'm not happy with the results for creating content I have used it and I have done experiments and I don't think that they I can speed up the uh the the content creation even if it means that I generate two paragraphs because I'm stuck and then I rewrite them completely like rewriting existing content is easier for a writer than writing content from zero on a BL page so AI is here to speed up make us more productive uh but the results are not creative they are not new they are not something I will use blindly and I will not go exactly on the okay let me go first on how I use it and then how I think people should not use it I use it to create scripts I used it recently to fix some schema issues and because I'm working on getting our knowledge panel and I'm while I study schema I try to understand it but I it's difficult for me to write the code so I use AI to write the first part and then I fix it um so I'm using to write scripts of codes Json code I I I write spreadsheets Json to help me speed up some processes on Google spreadsheet that I use to make my analysis I use it sometimes for outli or creating con and stop my writers block because I'm also not so technically I'm more of a con SEO I analyze con I write con as well so it speeds up the process and now writing team actually uses for that and brainstorming outlining and briefing all these are actually good uses as long as you edit them on top I will not use it just to blindly write com I even try and saw how programmatic content works I tested it so I know what I can I I need to do to create a programmatic database but I decided not to do it then the problem with AI is that it gives a wrong impression AI you see right now we're talking about recession this are this detail will go much later like uh uh today I was pushing a newsletter on my LinkedIn about the recession market and every company right now is cutting budgets and they're expecting that AI can save them for hiring Outsourcing or firing some people to save costs it's all the reality this is delusional thinking from CEOs that are too far from the actual truth the reason is that first of all your employees have to be expert from Rikers they have to know how to use a you cannot imagine how many people both in SEO in marketing not in marketing are terrible with technology they do not know how to use promting I am barely average on promting and maybe I'm not even average and I have been using it for almost a year now uh prompting is difficult to get good results and understand the results and shift the results and have the experience to use them it's not as easy a lot of people are producing bad content or bad results on AI so saying that you get a team of five writers let's say and replace them with two writers and AI for me it's almost delusional it's a good idea if you are a CFO and seeing the numbers on a spreadsheet in reality producing the same quality of qu five writers with research with doing interviews with doing whatever you need to produce a content with AI is crazy because no one tells you that these two writers will be experts of promting delivering and the condent H so I'm not so bullish that AI will take over everything I do think AI will change our lives it will make us more productive but you and me will not to lose our jobs because the same way we're becoming more productive and we're doing mistakes as well the same way our competitors are becoming more productive and they're doing the same mistakes people who utilizing much better will get ahead but for me most companies are average most people are average and most people will not over routinize it they will barely use it on their everyday life they will barely use it for their work they will use it occasionally to improve some productivity but it's not about to do Miracles but we're in a very very early bad phase of AI is just becoming usable wouldn't see huge changes over the next two three years they will be fast but they still need some time to walk to a point where it will really change and maybe what I'm saying right now in one year is going to be relevant or in two years because AI will evolve so much I will produce much better com that I can do with research in five days Nick last question I have for you um I would like to ask you to paint picture um about the future of SAS marketing or SEO growth marketing whatever you want to you know this this picture to to include more is going this is what I'm seeing right now more is going to measurable attributed actions but it's not exactly the right way we need as seos as marketers to measure our results but we need to understand the limitations and understand that sometimes cut feelings can bring you better results and the best marketers are the best cut feel for beginning and we we need to change our tactics whatever was working one or two years is will not be working the basics as we discuss here of marketing are still in effect if you're doing brand activities getting good content having a connection with your client talking the language of your client uh be giving a facee to the faceless Corporation those are the most effective tactics they're not new they're very old we just see them in a different format in a different way whether this talk or the new social media or what Elon mass is going to do with X eventually this we do not know but focus on being a good Market de on the basics Nothing Else Matters then you have to discover what's best on the channel but for the next couple of years if if we're going to a change more difficult climate we have to get some skills like being able to measure being able to attribute results and I will argue about progressing your life by improving your soft skills soft skills in a corporate environment especially and not just in corporate environment collaborating with others being able to P your idea listen to other people collaborate um being a friendly face around and being an easy person to work with others are more important than even your best hardcore those people will succeed we have to be these people I think that's a great way to close this episode um Nick um last question and call to action actually uh not question as much as call to action working people will find out more about you uh and get in touch I'm building a personal brand on LinkedIn I have a
