## Transcript

we tried to scale Too Fast Too Soon that cost us quite a bit of money I would say that was one of the bigger mistakes the consequence of that was that when you look at Ocean it's really mindboggling how it works and simple and everything else but there's a lot of algorithms and all kinds of things behind it to make it look that is efficient so we needed a very high cognitive skills from our sales to understand how how to convey ocean to a customer and I think that was probably the biggest problem for us to in a market where everyone could go into sales to attract the best ones today the story is very different we probably have one of the best sales teams in the market but in the early days it was that was the tough part that was really the tough part getting someone who really understood uh what we did into ocean.
