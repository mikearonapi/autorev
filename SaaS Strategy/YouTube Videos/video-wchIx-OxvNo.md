## Transcript

I am not here to speak as any kind of thought leader thankfully I brought a few um and I just want to thank my panelists all the attendees and also Salesforce for partnering with us on this event I think we're gonna we're in for some some great uh content some discussion and some great food as well so before we get started cheers to all the viewers no cheers yeah [Music] so I'll start by introducing our panelists here I am joined uh left to right by Aaron Dunn who is scale path uh Nicole mace who is the VP of product growth at pendo and Kurt Tim send nailed it who is director of growth at openc Partners so if you came here to learn about CLG you couldn't ask for a better crew and to get things started I thought to ask the same question to the group and it's rooted in users so when we talk about plg we're very interested in our users and what their feedback is and trying to lead them to that aha moment so I thought to ask each of you you're all you know very bright admissions people your careers could have taken you different places what was that aha moment where you sort of realized hey there's something for this plg like I want to focus my career on um Aaron we'll start with you thank God you said plg because I don't know how I got into marketing but um can you hear me is this mike working at all I can't tell speak louder talk louder got it okay this is not going to be awkward even a little bit but uh got it so um I I'll be honest I sort of fell into plg um as I think many of you who have been in marketing a long time um uh things happen to you I see I feel a little bit like Forrest Gump I've been involved in the content marketing inbound marketing and Compass marketing plg and um I sort of just call it good marketing uh the names change somebody much smarter than me will give it give it an acronym at the right time but I've sort of seen a lot of different models and I didn't know that plg was happening to me to be perfectly honest I worked for an openview portfolio company called intronus and um uh the lead partner at openview was telling us about all these amazing things and how we should really focus on our free trial experience and getting people into the trial and then that would you know generate an amazing riches and this was in 2013 14 15 and now they've dubbed that plg so I'm like great so sort of happened to me but I think it's fascinating we'll talk more about why I think that's fascinating but it's a really interesting opportunity it's a really interesting time in the market to be thinking about using your product to drive accelerating growth so it's a lot of fun I can tell you that awesome uh can you hear me closer louder closer can you hear me now louder is it still red it's red here oh yeah companies um yeah so um I I actually told Adrian this story and he said well you have to share this um so one of my sort of most amazing plg experiences was when I was at logged me in LastPass was my product um anyone here use LastPass yes yes oh yeah awesome um you may know me as the face of the LastPass paywall so um about a couple years ago if it happened to you you can raise your hand when you realize it were part of the paywall a log man was bought by Francisco partners and they rightly looked at LastPass and said oh my gosh you have millions millions of active users we had six and a half million active users and you've not monetized enough of them so you need to figure out how to monetize them and your job is to figure that out and you know we looked at well we could put in a bunch of little paywalls or we could put in a really big paywall so we took every engineer off what they were working on on the consumer side and we put in an unbelievable paywall and our job we had to monetize it and it didn't really feel good you don't ever want to do something not good to your users but from a business standpoint of course you need to do that so what we did we really tried to create a the best possible experience for a paywall and we did things like we notified people way up front said hey this is going to happen you're going to have to choose mobile or desktop really soon you have 30 days and then when we hit the 30 days we let them choose you can try out mobile for a little bit then you can switch back to desktop we really wanted to make it as nice as possible we did a massive amount of usability testing including all the marketing messages the whole experience to try to soften the blow so then the blow came and we had we increased our Revenue in a two-month period on the consumer Side by 70 it was unbelievable people bought and I think you know people those of us who use LastPass know that it's something that's really invaluable so a whole set of people said I'm happy to buy you've been providing me value and then a whole set of people were not happy we had over 150 negative articles written about us we were all over Reddit which if you've engaged with Reddit you know can't really respond so you just see it and cringe but that's what happened and in the end and you know especially the engineers no one really wanted to do this pay Ball but in the end we felt like you know we really did the we did right by the business and so many of these customers came over and and wanted to buy uh LastPass so it's really an incredible experience with millions of users to play with I don't know that I'll have that experience again but my moral of the story for plg is when you're thinking about creating a free product if you don't have one in place think about how you're going to monetize it down the road so you don't come in later and have to put a really harsh paywall in place so that's that's my moral Kurt we're working oh yes yours really works so I'll start off by saying that I have two loves uh one is plg and the other is the New York Yankees uh I'm missing the ninth inning right now it's a tough one yeah but but tonight's plg won yeah what do we got I'll get you I got you they had to turn the TV off so my sort of aha moment to your question Adrian started at fuse where I ran business operations and for those that don't know if you sold telephony to Enterprises we had this like very sales heavy sales lead motion uh and I was tasked with trying to make it more efficient we had a plethora of opportunity within our current base of customers to sell more uh and it was this friction heavy process to do so they couldn't go and just buy more users they had to come and go through a contract process as well as new leads that were coming in that had to go through our whole scoping process sign an NDA it was just this very very friction heavy process um and we were looking for ways to solve it uh we knew that the product was something that people wanted and we were preventing him from getting it into their hands uh and I happened upon the openview blog uh and started to realize that there were so many ways that through onboarding as well as customer experience that we were just putting friction in front of our customers when all they wanted was more and more of the product and so we started to switch gears and put the product in front of it all and I had such a good time doing it I reached out to openview to try to get a job to go do that with all their portfolio companies and that's where I am now nice they won they won me over no the Yankees won the Yankees every everyone the year the Yankees won we're flying to Houston you can thank you okay he's got the good mic yeah it's like the good League um so a couple questions uh for each of you uh Aaron you've been through plg motions before I believe a lot of people here who are in saf as excuse me sales LED businesses that are kind of mulling like how do I go how do I get started so maybe talk to us about how you get started with field yeah I'm happy to actually show a hands quick how many people are purely sales LED and don't have any free trial or plg experience today so I'm not sure yeah tell me a little bit about the not sure do you have a free trial or not oh do we have plc I know there's a form somewhere yeah understood so yeah I mean I think that we're all many people are reading about what it can do and seeing all those really amazing success stories in the market but then there's becomes a reality and so if you have a silver emotion already and this is something I've been through actually pretty much everywhere I've worked and so it really understanding what is the goal of the plg motion why are you trying to do it and what is the outcome you're trying to drive so sales is selling all of your deals whether that's a good thing or not um the second you start talking about those products sales starts asking a lot of questions like oh wait what about my commission and what about my quota is my quarter going to change they even go down um and so um when you're when you're introducing your product emotion the first thing you have to do is what you're trying to achieve and and what is the goal if you're trying to open up a new market that often can be easier because um commercial engineering that needs to be done so you don't freak out your sales team and you're actually additive to the business as opposed to taking away from from your existing Notions it's not a it's not a small project it's not put up a free trial and and and we'll talk a lot about friction here today there's a lot of friction in the process don't lose sight of the sales force version because they are you know the life of your business today and if you crater that then you're gonna have a big problem I could go on for an hour okay come back to me on that one okay uh thank you Aaron Nicole uh love reading stories and you can sort of realize he told us about the last past paywall Aaron just touched on timing can you talked to us about you know you have he sounds like you had a base of free users on LastPass your private Equity investor said let's monetize what did that timing look like and what were how did you measure along the way before you got to pay one you were monetizing how did you know we're on track we're off track you know how did you manage it together nope no that's a better mic okay just all right so how actually um kind of an interesting story so like a lot of companies uh last class was a prior if I logged me in and at the time of acquisition actually there was a paywall in the place there was you know you had to choose mobile or desktop and they said actually we want more free users so we're going to get rid of the paywall to grow our free base so when they made that decision they felt like it was a one-way door and we talked about this before I don't know if you know the Amazon one-way door versus two-way door one-way door is you make a decision and you can never go back from it a two-way door is you can go back from it and it really I love thinking about that because it really forces you to say it's not that big a decision but when they made that decision they thought it was a one-way door and then when private Equity wanted to monetize we really pushed ourselves and did it really need to be a one-way door and we were able to go back on that but it was hard it was a very very hard thing to do so as far as timing I think it for LastPass in particular it was more business needs right um Francisco Partners had logged me in and there was just too much on the table when you look at the percent and over time when you have a free product a bunch of free users and you have paid users the ratio you need to have the right ratio it's expensive to keep all of those free users and you want to be providing more value to your paid customers so there is that point and a lot goes into around the cost and then the opportunity cost of not getting those users to pay so I don't know if it's a specific timing thing but it can be just in the life of the company when does it make sense to to monetize I don't know that that's a good answer but it really depends it works it's a question you've occurred um thank you Randy for being here all good can do openview invests in both native plg companies as well as sales LED SAS companies that have strong plg potential true correct yeah so what if you as the investor what do you look for when you're looking at a sales tax companies say hey this has got strong plg potential yeah it's a great question um I think there are things that companies do well that we identify and then there are things that companies do poorly that we identify and both sort of speak to that potential uh so one example is probably LastPass is a good example uh we'll go talk to end users uh and not like the manager who bought the product or the CTO we'll go talk to the engineer or the accountant that's actually using the software on a daily basis and we'll ask them what would it feel like if we took this away from you uh and if somebody got LastPass taken away from them they'd freak out right uh and so you start to see signs like that of like the value of the product is actually delivering is so high um that the real problem is getting that user to that value as quickly as you possibly can and so that's one of the signs of potential the other side is uh we'll listen to like things like gong calls and we'll hear customers on the call that look ready to buy and they're saying that they're ready to buy but there's this process in place where well we need to bring in a Solutions consultant and you haven't seen this part of the demo and the company themselves are putting friction into the sales process uh which is just another sign that if customers are recognizing they're ready to buy before you're really like willing to let them buy that's just one of those signs that's like okay we can streamline this process like we don't need to have a six-month sales cycle we can cut that down to two months for you know half of our segment or whatever it is it's so true I'm just gonna jump in yeah pretty good great the mic goes through you so the the amazing thing about it is I most recently happened to August I work for a company called care Academy which was in the training space for in compliance space for caregiver training for home care agencies and people were like there's no way that anybody would ever buy this product just by putting in a credit card and never talking to a salesperson and we said well if we don't do it someone else is going to do it to us so might as well be us and so we put up a trial and put up a way very very hacked together rudimentary way to actually buy the product and sure enough people did it and and so you know buyer behavior is changing pretty dramatically and you know you can lead it or you can follow it and it's much better to lead it but it's it's really hard and understanding what that user behavior is you mentioned the moment of aha um don't assume that you know what the moment of aha is because it's probably a little different than what you think it is um we we took a look at what our sales people thought it was then we talked to our customer success people about what they were hearing from the customers and then we watched usage patterns we didn't actually have pendo then um we should have but we then we talked to a whole bunch of customers to figure out what was the what was the the moment where they said yeah the question we asked is when does the sales call when does the prospect Lean Forward I mean we've all been there right we've all been buyers too we're like oh wait that's interesting what was that one when did the prospect lean forward and say all right tell me more about that and it's different it's probably three or four months depending on products and in your buying motion but listen for that find that and then drive your customers your prospects to that moment um you know you talk about users and it's so crucial to the motion and I think saleswa isn't as accustomed to that talk to us about balancing the qualitative and the quantitative that he goes on I think if the goal is on your LinkedIn where it's like the quantitative use locative feedback how do you navigate that intersection to actually take actual insights into drive plg forward yeah I mean that's really when it's magical right when you when you hear from customers whether you're doing interviews or usability testing and you get some Direction like wow this might actually be happening and then to be able to dig into the numbers and to actually be able to prove and create a case that there is an opportunity here or there I mean I think you know in many products with product like rose you are trying to find that aha experience you are trying to find that silver bullet of if they only saw this feature in my product then they would actually go ahead and buy and so a lot of times you can look at the data and look at the data and it's like not quite gelling right it's helpful but when you hear when you put together what you're here in interviews and usability testing with that data that's when you can really get your arms around oh it's this feature right um like we knew for example with LastPass um our sort of Silver Bullet feature nobody really knew about which was dark web monitoring everyone said when you would ask them an interview yes I definitely want that and we would see if people went there they would buy um they would retain longer but our challenge was to get people to that feature but having both of those together was great and then we were able to guide the user right in I wouldn't say that was the aha moment but that was the moment um the AHA moments actually when you're able to populate your password into something right you don't have to actually look it up but really driving people to to the feature that you know is going to keep them is really is really critical so you know while we have all this data today there really is nothing better than layering on that that qualitative with it for sure I think that at care Academy you know we heard that our compliance reporting pushed by the compliance reporting if you've ever if you understand anything about caregiving and home care agencies um there's 50 states 50 different rules plus the federal government has their own rules and then depending on whether or not you pay yourself for the care or whether or not Medicare covers it is a whole other set of rules and we had a a really sophisticated reporting engine so you know we could deliver the compliance report that they they needed for the audit and people love that and so um we said all right cool that's a moment where people lean forward and go I want to buy great let's get people to that and we got a whole bunch of people for that but wouldn't you know it the report was blank because if you haven't taken any classes to say hey I've met my audit requirements um so we're showing you a blank report that's not a great experience and so we wound up having to drive a whole bunch of engineering work to basically populate a report and say okay this is what it would look like um and you know maybe you should go take a class or two but the problem was you actually had to finish a class and I don't know you know if you're evaluating software you don't have an hour or two to watch a class about something you don't necessarily need so this is where the the data tells you one thing but then you also need to experience it yourself to understand what you know what's happening there what's that balance for sure that was a lot of pressure I hope you have something to say I do good Yankees won Yo Yankees I am more than just a Yankee fan um so I look at the qualitative feedback as a really awesome breeding ground for tests that you can go wrong uh and so if someone says you know I really started to love this product or I would never churn off this product once I realized that it was really easy to integrate with all of my other tools we would take that information with with a lot of the companies that we work with and we would say okay so how can we see that in the data how can we see which companies are actually getting to that point uh and so with one of our companies pipefi we looked at how many days does it take for them to set up an integration and we realized that companies that do set up an integration are much more likely to buy more they're much less likely to churn uh okay what tests can we run to try to get users to put an integration in earlier and then can we see that other customers that do do that are also having that same behavior of expanding more or churning less and so I think the qualitative is an awesome place to start but then you need to tie that back to the data to actually start testing uh you know doing tests and seeing if they're actually going to work thank you pass it right back to you and we'll come down this way uh plg reminds me a bit about a couple years ago ADM AVX whereas a lot of companies want to do it and it represents a shift in mindset and strategy and execution and above all else really requires alignment internally cross-functionally talk to us if you will about you know best practices for driving that alignment to get everyone kind of merged in the same direction yeah uh it's really tricky it's I mean it's a problem that every Enterprise deals with whether it's plg or some other big task uh when I was at fuse one of the first things that I did was establish a program management office which do any of you have like a pmo or anything like that to work cross-functionally today yeah um when we started we tried to collect all the projects that were going on cross-functional uh there were 62. that's impossible you can't do 62 things cross-functionally at the same time and so we narrowed that down to like what are the big priorities that we need to work on uh and one of them was plg and every Department was represented both at the executive level as well as as well as at the mid-level of one of the things that we need from each department uh one of the things we're going to have to enable everyone on to actually execute and I think without that we really would have struggled there are definitely hacks that that I think are worth talking about but ultimately without that type of structure where we had every executive in the room it wouldn't have really gotten to the place that it did at fuse yeah I mean we are actually in the middle of this at the moment um at pendo so even though pendo is a tool and I used it at LastPass for a product like growth pendo is a company that has historically been sales LED there's a premium product that's been around now three years but I was hired we built up a team and we had support from the c-suite of we need to get serious about a plg motion and that was actually putting resources towards it and getting people on board with this is what we're going to do this is how it's going to work and it's not easy it's not easy you can get Engineers on board you can get data science on board you can get marketing on board with sales as another another thing right and it's mainly they're very busy right sales is very busy and um I think we're at the time where we're learning that the sales enablement needed to come earlier even though they weren't perhaps fully ready to hear about it so I guess it's kind of my takeaway with our experience now is sales enablement should have come earlier but we should have done it more often right as we're rolling out so we're rolling out um we're in beta right now for self-serve pay for a starter plan and you know we have opportunities in Salesforce that are active for low-level plans so how do how do you kind of work through that so really coming to alignment okay you know these these opportunity sales you need to see through and then we're full force with um with our starter plan so it's time to figure that out but then also talking a lot about the value for sales as you're moving forward the flywheel is amazing right in many ways not only free but just that early entry into something you're going to self-serve pay for is actually a super pql and sales loves that um we know that our sales team was not excited about a premium product and now they love free and it's really helped them grow their business so I look at this as sort of the next phase of really offering a way for people to kind of dip their toes and put a credit card down for pendo and as they grow you know we'll be with them and we'll expose more features and functionality to them and higher plans but it's not it's not easy it is not easy I think I always think it might be easier if you start first CLG and later on sales because it's just a massive shift in the organization even though intuitively people do understand and agree yes these really down market sales it shouldn't appeal too right we shouldn't put too much of our effort into those let's just get them started it's just still a big shift in the organization so we're in learning phase but my my one thing as sales enablement you know do as much I agree 100 um and the big difference between when you started with around ABM or inbound or whatever because that's uh largely can be driven by marketing and maybe marketing and sales but um shifting into a plg motion as a whole business opportunity and if you're in marketing or growth or or you're trying to do it alone it's gonna be really hard to be successful you need the whole organization you need product you need sales you need customer success all on board with you in whatever form that takes on your company and um it's a big cross-functional project we struggled a little bit in the early days when I first joined care Academy because we were operating in silos so marketing was doing some things customer success was doing some things and product was doing something completely different and we were all out of phase so you know I joined and and I said all right sat down with my director commander and said cool we're going to start a free trial and I built this massive I should have brought it with me actually this massive uh piece of paper really you know we remember what those aren't pieces of paper and um and in red I circled every place there was a point of friction and then I sat down with my product leader and said cool which one of these can be attacked first then he's like great I can get to that in four months I was like yeah I want to do that now he's like I can't do it right roadmaps committed four months later he came back to me and said great I'm ready to tackle this and I was like yeah but we've moved on we've got this big launch next week and you know meanwhile customer success was doing whatever they were doing and so we were out of phase so we really we took a moment actually and had some great Insight from a from somebody a company called cybrary about what they had done we we created a little bit of a growth team um we hacked it together it wasn't organizationally mandated we just took a marketer we took a customer success first and we took a product person we put them in a box it said go do some stuff we don't know what you should do but just go do it you figure it out and so and they started working in Sprints and they had uh you know sort of a testing mindset and it was our first real sort of cross-functional project and we got so many things done one of the big points encryption was after you signed up we dumped you one of those random page that made perfectly great sense if you had just bought the product through sales would make absolutely no sense if you were had never talked to sales and um and oh actually that's not true we also send you an email login wow I mean that just dies right um if those of you who know rapid seven we're based here in Boston um they learned that a long time ago just don't send people an email with a login let them into the product right away well that's hard work and so we had to engineer that out and um it wasn't until we really started thinking cross-functionally and putting people and aligning them around goal that we really start to see that that effort she's crazy all right I think we'll do one more question each and I mean sit down yeah if today if you have questions to you um for Kurt you've got an existing sales like company and they're thinking about plg what is the investor perspective on buy versus Bills uh when it comes to the product or when it comes to the tech stack versus buying a company that's doing it in their kind of cross Market yeah no it makes a lot of sense uh it's a tricky question to ask it's going to be super uh specific to your situation um I think that if your first move is to go to your Finance team and talk about how you need to acquire a company and that's the only way to get started uh you're probably going too far towards the Buy Route um I think it's more important to think about what are the the smaller things we can do internally to get started get some validation that like there's something here uh and then that might be the right time to think okay there's this awesome tool out there that's further down Market but would bring in a bunch of users like now maybe it makes sense um the other thing that's worth mentioning I think it's we've said a lot of things about how it's very intimidating to like go and Tackle plg uh I also think it's very easy to dip a toe in uh like if you want to turn the business around it's going to take years and and uh you need to build uh it's a lot of engineering work it's not something you can do tomorrow but one of the things that you can do is go try to buy your product tomorrow and just see how hard it is uh go try to buy another user uh you know pretend to be a customer of yours and see how hard that is go try to understand one of the features that you just launched uh and and start to try to figure out what are those things that make it difficult to do that and Tackle one of them uh you're not going to become plg overnight um but there are there are infinite Little Things any company can do that circle around plg that are 100 worth testing without you know going to your Finance person and say hey we got to spend 50 million dollars and buy this business what's one little thing that one action people could take leaving your plg I think you just answered the question which is you know go buy your own products and audit the version uh any questions from the audience for the panel here I I have a few questions but I think the most recent one came in mind is how do you do hits of plg so it is a entire experience an entire process of getting a middle of an end and I thought I heard you know I should try one uh that's not plg is it depends in the world yeah uh I hate gatekeeping plg to say like the worst conversation we could have in this room is like is it plg or is that not right like if I don't have a free trial like am I still able to be plg or if I just have a free trial am I suddenly plg um the simplest way to think about it is your product is the leading motion towards attracting retaining and expanding customers right and so that can mean infinite things um there are multiple sections to a customer like fully adopting your product one of them is starting right uh you know they go to your website what are they clicking what's the call to action uh are they finding what they're looking for when they look at the language on your website does it seem like it's a product for them the next is sort of activating so like what is that aha moment what do we think is the thing that users do to realize that there's value in this product uh the next is converting a user right so like where is that paywall uh you know do they feel like they're paying for something that they've already gotten value for uh or are they sort of taking a Gamble and then the last would be scaling and so through Discover and start and activate and convert and scale they're just little things that you might be able to find that you can go tackle you know in the next two months right and put a test in place so you know should we change um the way that customers schedule a demo can we make it so that they can just watch a demo you know do our users love scheduling a demo or do they just want to go watch something and so you'll start to find some of these tests but through that funnel I think that's where you'll you'll find that point there are ways to fake it and test it so you and and that's part of the fun right you're experimenting you're trying to see what works um one thing that Kendo did for a long time is actually have trials that the customer fills out a form and says yes I want to try out pendo and when they they click the form a salesperson calls them and says great on turning on the product for you and you can go in and play around for seven days and we will catch up and you can tell me how it is and you can watch the data you can watch you that your child user go in you can see what they click on and then you can be there to answer their questions so it's you know you're faking a trial but you're also learning so much that helps you understand well what needs to be in my trial and what it what is that onboarding where are they getting stuck along the way so um I encourage you to fake it so that you make it with it um I think you know there are lots of the things that you can do pendo as I said I used it when I wasn't at pendo you can put up you know guides that take up the entire page and shut people out you know you can say you can come for 14 days and then after 14 days you just turn on a guide and you can't access anything as a user so there are things and you can have a message on there that says your child's over call us right so try to be a creative and um you know try different things see if there are ways that you can get users into your product and experiencing some value and Kurt Kurt and I go over each other there's um there's also the sidecar which which is a lot of fun and I'm taking um your your line here but I love the sidecar so much which is if you have a little thing a widget of something um I'll let you tell your sidecar but if you have a little something that you can offer for free that the user can get into and and have a great experience and receive some value then you're in a case where where you can talk to them more about the rest of your offerings you just need to say something more about that I thought you nailed it So Yesterday two-day trials or 30 days we should talk over dinner and we'll give you a much better answer so are you testing the product or not how long does your product deliver until yeah so how long does it take how long does it take for your customer to get value uh one of the things that I love instead of a time-based trial it's an action-based trial so if it's slack you know you get 2 000 messages uh like we view that as enough time to see value in it uh if you're ready to do that on day one great if it's gonna take you 14 days to get there 30 days to get there take your time like that's fine we're not here to push you um one of the things I love with onboarding is you know you get a 10-day trial but when you do certain things you unlock more days to your trial so we know if you're gonna do X Y and Z you're gonna love this thing so if you do X you're you just added four days to your drop uh it's kind of a gamification thing it's a little bit of a hack but I don't I don't think there's an easy answer to two or 30 days there is actually put it in the data in the data there you go so we uh we had a 90-day trial when I got there like that sales was crying like no no no it is too long um and so they made a decision 45 or 30 and that's like yeah that seems too long too what we did is we just watched YouTube Behavior and it turned out that absent sales interaction you were either in it in seven days or ten days or you weren't and so we cut it down to a 14-day free trial and it actually just made all the difference in the world two days seemed a little impressive but you know I mean maybe it works and I think that the um the other thing I would just say sorry back to the previous point is I hear two things all the time in plg Land one well we can't free trial our products so we can't do plg and two Enterprises will never buy plg products uh can we swear uh two things first of all you can peel I don't know what the sidecar is I want to hear about this but you you can always find something um you can fake a pre-trial I love that and I've done that before um you can um you know create it you create something that is maybe light engineering to get people into your product we did this at Snap app where we basically hacked down our product and put it into a PDF accelerator and say hey this is you know this is this is what plg looks like for us and maybe not the Enterprise is going to spend you know millions of dollars in your product and take six months to buy maybe the buying committee isn't doing a true plg motion but I promise you that the end users who are part of that buying committee are and they will welcome your plg motion because all your competitors are not doing it real competitive Advanced review there to dive in on that like I said at care Academy we figure well if we don't do it someone's going to do it to us so it might as well lead us yeah okay any other questions before we have dinner yeah it's like our story it's better because um so it a lot of your products are probably too complicated for like a very simple end user free trial motion right um HubSpot is a pretty complicated product uh they took a very sales lead motion early on um where they would sell to the CMO uh this big long contract process but uh there was a reason for that to adopt the product it took education it took enablement took training uh but what they did do was they developed a website grader so they took part of their Tech stack and they put it on their website and it was one of the major call to actions and it was drop in your url we'll grade your website we'll give you a piece of value and what you're doing there is you're educating the customer on what your product can do in a way that they can self-service you're never going to provide the entirety of HubSpot overnight um and so HubSpot does this safety culture is another one that has like beautiful forms and templates you can download and the cool thing is you're like accidentally training your customer how to use your product and before they know it they've created an account they've started to save certain things and then when you get a call from a sales rep it's a much easier conversation hey I saw you did this it seems like you might also be interested in doing this and so that's the sidecar product it's it's not Infamous but it does exist you don't know what actually happened I was I was probably too young to know the real story there sorry I'm kidding so um which is amazing so the one thing that HubSpot did it is they're part of the radio engine is the marketing greater fantastic um I think it still exists I think oh yeah I was looking at it today is that right um in the early days you put in your URL and you put in an email address and you got I'm pretty sure Mike will be typed this up in its spare time you cut an email back with like 25 things that were wrong with your website and like if you it wasn't a plg motion because you couldn't actually get another product from there per se um but it was incredibly valuable and it was um super hacked and um I don't know that this article exists but I did a whole series of marshmallows way back in the day called the Wayback machine and you know so Mike Volpe talks about when he was still in hotspot he's like oh we've got a million users and we've got all this other stuff you know we've got a Blog it's getting you know a million view business you know a month and I raised my hand and said hey Mike you know what did you do when you were employee number six that got you to this point because you know we're all employee number six we're not where you are today and he's like marketing grader um but then they want to sidekick because I thought where you're going so sidekick was their first sales product which was free and it was targeted sales people and that was their first attempt to get sales people to use the product and be uh and then it became leads for them I think yes where I did this kind of a little bit too where get a whole bunch of sales people using it and then cool we're gonna roll that up into CRM which is much more of a true product that emotion in the end but a lot of interesting things Amazon's a great case study we should just talk about them foreign [Applause] I would ask one person at each of the tables to volunteer as a bit of a table leave I'll let the egos up there who that person's gonna be and a lot of questions out there for some discussion which is you know looking at where you're at today what's the biggest data Gap that you see within your organization that's kind of like you need to bridge this data down in order to to launch a plg motion so uh we'll come back later and we'll pass some money to some people other than the four of us and uh and hear from you and uh in the meantime the phone number.
