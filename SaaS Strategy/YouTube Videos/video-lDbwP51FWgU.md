Worried your SaaS offering isn't priced
right? You're not alone. Pricing is perhaps the most difficult
nut to crack in SaaS. Let's meet an expert
in this episode of Closing Time. Thanks for tuning in to Closing Time,
the show for go to Market Leaders. I'm Val Riley, head of marketing
for Unbounce and Insighly.

Today I'm joined by Bill Wilson. He is founder and CEO of Pace Pricing, a B2B SaaS pricing consultancy. Welcome to the show, Bill. Hi, Val. It's great to be here.

Thanks. So, Bill, I've been in this business
since the birth of SaaS. I'm not ashamed to say
I can remember pricing conversations, actually debates
really that I was having back in 2012. Suffice it to say that this is a hot button issue. Why is pricing so challenging? That's a that's a great question.

And you and I are,
come from the same place there. I've been in rooms
with these conversations for a long time. I think the biggest reason is that it
starts to tinker directly with the relationship
between you and your customers. And then I always feels
a little bit uncomfortable. So I think people naturally fear
pricing changes or conversations about pricing because it feels like once
it's set, it's so delicate.

How can we possibly change it? Save maybe a price increase? But when it comes to actually
having those conversations, no one really wants to. No one really wants to upset customers. And I think there's a lot of anxiety
and fear built in to, pricing and, and primarily
I think it's just due to, just those unknowns, just, you know, we scared
we're we're afraid of what we don't know. And I think that's what ends up happening
a lot is people, don't know how people are going to react. They don't know how the market's
going to react.

They don't know how their
existing customers are going to react. Is everybody going to churn?
They all these fears. And so I think that's probably
the biggest, the biggest reason it's becomes a hot
button issue is it becomes very, everybody has an opinion on it
because of that. All that resonates with me. Let's start with the basics.

How about that? Who in a SaaS company owns pricing? Meaning what member of the leadership team in an organization
should be in charge of it. Right. Yeah. I think there's, I think it varies
depending on the company, but at the end of the day,
the decision is going to end with the CEO probably, you know,
depending on the size of the company. So CEO is highly involved, 
head of product, for sure, I would say is heavily
involved in the deciding factors.

But yeah, mostly what I see is there's always
there's always the C-level like, and usually the CEO is making
that sort of final decision. Yes. This is the model we'll go with. Yes. This is how we're going to do it.

But the team itself is cross-functional, and I think that's probably the most important piece
is that you've got representation from product, you got representation
from marketing, customer success, sales, sometimes operations like finance,
like revenue operations, of course, all of those people need to come together
to make true good,
you know, data-backed pricing decisions. And I think that's the thing I see
the most in these companies is there isn't that group, you know, the pricing function
is delegated to one person. And, the, if you can build a group
of people together in your organization to actually start having conversations
about pricing, I think that will put you, streets ahead of many other companies. And you're putting product at the helm
essentially, because, if we're building a feature. Right, we need to know how we're going to monetize that feature,
or else why build the feature.

Is that why product is kind of
at the center? 100%, I think, product,
it is one of those pieces that, they're taking in
all the information from the customers. They're having those interviews. There's,
you know, getting all the data. They understand the product
from that level. They're taking in data from sales
and marketing, all these places.

And I think if they're going to build something,
then one of the top three questions they need to be asking is, how are we going to monetize this
before they even build it? And if we're not,
I think we're making a big mistake because I've seen this before
where, you know, we'll build out features
and then we'll go, cool, like, where does this fit?
And that's the wrong time to have the conversation,
because a number of, you know, the monetization discussion can even impact what the feature is,
or how it's implemented. So I think that's why I put so much, you know, power in the, in the product
person's hand, not just because I'm a product person, but,
that's where I think it lies. Yeah. So in your experience, tell me, what are some things that SaaS companies
typically get wrong about pricing? I think the biggest thing
people get wrong, we've touched on this a little bit already
is that they just don't change it. I think that's probably
the biggest mistake I see in pricing is people
not changing their pricing at all.

It can be years. I, you know, it's not uncommon for me to talk to founders
and ask the question, when was the last time
you changed your pricing? And they either can't remember or they'll be like,
yeah, it's it's been many, many years. I feel like you have a cheat sheet
behind the curtain of every SaaS company I've worked for. Because we've always had, like, you know,
these people are on the 2016 pricing, and these people are on the,
you know, the, the pricing that's groups of users
as opposed to by user. it makes me feel good
that maybe it's systemic and it's not just the organizations
I've worked for.

So thank you for that. Ok, so we just covered what folks get wrong about pricing. But how do you know if you're getting
if you're getting your pricing right. What are some indicators. Yeah, it's a good question.

I think, this one thing
I've noticed recently is that at the very beginning,
say you start off with a small, you know, smaller contract mid-market,
you know, and say you're charging per user,
this is a classic example. Right. Okay. It'll feel fine, right? The value,
the value, connection feels fine. It's like.

Yeah, no problem. We can have 50 users on it
and we'll move forward. But as that account
grows and grows and grows, what I've seen is the slight deviation over time between what they're paying
and what they're getting. And then all of a sudden they it trips a switch where they
all of a sudden don't feel like it's fair. And so I think that's
one of the ways that you can tell, if you've got pricing right,
is that if the value correlation stays with the account
as the account grows? Because if you do start
to get that diversion, then you do.

That's when you start to see churn. And that's that is
the function of churn is like at one point they saw value in the software
and they were happy to pay you for it. So what happened? You know,
and so I think, the big indication that you're getting it right
is, you know, reasonably low churn, high NPS scores. And that value connection stays as,
as customers grow, they still feel like it's fair, predictable, familiar,
like all of those things. So I think, 
some of those are big indicators.

So like value
alignment is really, really important. And then value capture is the other way. You know, you've got pricing. Right. So what do you mean by value
capture is is that okay.

We are aligned here. But are we capturing all the areas
we can possibly capture. And usually a good, hint for that for me
is, you know, net, you know, net dollar retention. You know, well above 100%, which basically
means we have good expansion motion inside the packages. And I think that's another really
great way to tell that if you've got if you've got some things right.

So yeah, value capture, value alignment. And then of course there's
pricing ability inside the organization. Are we monitoring it. What are we monitoring. What decisions are we making
about pricing on a on a quarterly basis.

And so if you got all three of those
things working really, really well, then I think that's when, you know,
you have, you have a pretty good handle on your pricing structure. And,
and it's working. I like the fact that you've mentioned
things like NPS and NRR. Because these are things that SaaS
businesses are already measuring. So you're not asking us to go out
and, like, you know, reinvent the wheel
and find a new metric? You're saying these are
the existing metrics you probably have that can give you an indication
that your pricing is on target.

Oh 100%. And I think that's
one of the biggest things I really try hard to work with the like,
let's work with the data you have. You know,
I think the biggest thing I see or the, the only piece of data
we find sometimes that people just don't have is usage data around,
you know, features and functionality. And that's sort of, 
an eye opener for product teams. And they usually go implement
it almost immediately.

And, and once you have that,
you've got all the makings to be able to make all the decisions
you need to really confidently, Nice. Okay. That's encouraging. I'd like to switch gears to talk a little
bit about the elephant in the room. The dreaded pricing page.

This is something that I feel we in
SaaS are always, always iterating on. It never feels like it's done. How do you approach the pricing page
when you're in engagements with clients? Sure. I believe the pricing page is probably one of the hardest
working pages on your website. And so therefore I need I think it needs
to be treated with the exact same level of care and detail as, say, your landing,
like your actual home page.

So for me, I look at it, I've tried to figure this out
over the years. And I've come up
with a way of looking at it that tries to keep it
as objective as possible. So I look at it
through a couple of lenses. I look at, you know, pricing pages
through, the idea of just clarity, you know, how clear is it about
who it's for and what I'm going to get? So that's sort of like the first stage. And then I look at, confidence.

It's like, how well are we building
confidence in the buyer as they are navigating the page? So those two things I think are probably the most important
because one, a confused mind never buys. So it's got to be super clear. And people love to find people
that look just like them and go, oh, if it worked for them, it's
going to work for me. And that builds confidence and trust. And so if we've got those two things
right, then we can start looking at what's going on in the packaging
and how are we getting to action.

And I think that's the other two pieces. So packaging and action. So I try and you know, look at everything through those lenses
as I go through the pages. But, you know, some of the big things
I see that people miss, and I'll just highlight some of the ones that people
miss all the time is the top of the price. The top of the pricing page
will just say pricing, or it will say, you know, pricing for every size company or pricing to fit your needs
or something like that.

I would suggest that everybody knows
they're on a pricing page, and we don't need to talk about the fact
that it's a pricing page. What I would do is I would revamp,
I would reiterate your value prop, your best value prop
should be at the top of that page. Who is it for? What am I going to get? And right underneath
that, do as best you can. At risk reversal. So free trial, no credit card required.

30 day money back guarantee. Trusted by thousands of companies. A little logo,
a little logo, a little logo. You know, like whatever it takes
to try and get people framed properly, that this is the value I'm going to get
and this is why you should trust us. Those that's probably the number one thing
I see that I flag.

And then after that it's using language
customers just don't understand. Right? We will all come up with
our own jargon and, you know, like words concatenated together that don't really mean anything
to anybody else but us. And we're so used to it
in our organization that, of course, it makes sense. So we become blind to some of this stuff. So I think I just try and tell people
like clear over clever, like don't get cute, you know,
you can call it whatever you want, but just make sure
they 100% understand it.

They're not in your world yet,
so they don't understand what clear sight is or whatever
the thing is you've called it. You need to. You need to be really, really clear. And sometimes it feels rudimentary. But I think that's way
better than the opposite.

So those are the big things I see, 
not surfacing the most important features
first in their, in their, in their grids. Like what's different
is probably the biggest thing. And then my last one that I absolutely
hate is the giant feature grid comparison on the pricing page. Now everybody's going to say that's
the point of the pricing page. Why are you saying that? I'm saying absolutely.

Let's surface the most important things
that differentiate these packages for the various personas,
the jobs-to-be-done, whatever way we are slicing up those packages, and then
let people who want to go deep, go deep. So I have a button that says view
all features or put it in each plan. And when they click on it, you get a lightbox
and then it just stays there. You can scroll inside it and
then you can close it when you're done. And you're right where you left off.

And I think that gets us a nice balance
between the people who are really just trying
to make a decision and decide if this is right for me and those people
who really want to go deep and compare it because they've been looking at
competitors or whatever it happens to be. So I think those are the
those are the things that I said a couple, but that was like four. But there's many more. Yes. I am sure that there are.

I mean, everything you said
I could visualize in my head. You know how different companies,
approach the pricing page, and it is. It's just it's a never ending task. I mean, we are currently doing some A/B
testing on our page, and I feel like that's the page
that you could A/B test in perpetuity. And still find incremental wins because
there's so much happening on that page.

So that was really great insight. yeah. There's never right. Like it's never right. It's just optimal.

So how do we get it to be optimal
for the time period? Yeah. Got it. Okay I think I'm going to use that
phrase also. So as part of that pricing page, you know, companies come up with tiers. Is there a way that you coach folks on how to create those pricing tiers
and, and, how they differentiate them? Yeah.

I think, a lot of SaaS companies,
especially when they first start, they will think they need to do this
sort of good better best small medium
large kind of packaging structure. And you can almost see this
when you go to a certain pages and you, and you realize that there's not a lot of differentiation
and they're just reaching to, to have the separation. Now that's fine. And I think what it does, though
is if people get into these conversations going, well,
what should be in the basic plan and what should be in the mid plan? We want everybody in the mid plan,
we know that. So let's make sure
most features are there.

But what do we strip out of the base plan. And that's to me
it seems like the wrong conversation. What I'd rather do is figure out, 
you know who it is we're serving the best. You know, how they get to value. Those are the two biggest questions.

And we may not know that early on,
but for reasonably seasoned companies, you can you can do that journey. And then really figure out
what is the core job to be done of our customer. And, and I mean, the core,
like the biggest job to be done. And the nice thing
about the jobs-to-be-done framework is it’s kind of agnostic of a technology. And so what that does is it forces
this is forces us into this idea that, this job is going to get done anyway.

They just happen
to be choosing our software to do it. And I think that's the biggest thing. So then, if we can start thinking about that,
it's like, well, what are the things, and just the things we need
in our software that will solve that job, like just the,
the minimum, you know, minimum viable packaging, I guess, to solve that
particular job to be done? And I think that's how you should start,
because if you start that way now, things become a lot easier because a customer now is getting full value
out of every package they get. They can solve the job they're trying
to get done all the way through. Now, can they solve it
any as many times as they want? Maybe.

Maybe not. There could be limits
on on various things. And that's how you can move
people from left to right. And then the other way to move
people left to right after that is like, what's the next job to be done
once they've solved this job to be done? And then they can start to think about,
okay, what are the things
that need to go in there? Oftentimes it becomes like insight
and analytics and workflows. And that often gets people moving
left to right.

It's like, how do I do
more of what I'm doing more efficiently? And I think in B2B
at least that's the progression I see. It's like if we can do a really great job
of jobs-to-be-done, figure out what you know,
what they need to do next, and then build in efficiencies, efficiency, productivity
and workflow across across the packages. We can get people moving. So that's how I coach people
to think about it. Basically jobs-to-be-done first,
it gives you clarity and you don't have to be fighting about,
well, let's remove this and remove that.

It's more like, well, do
we absolutely need this to solve that job? It's just a different question. Yeah. That's a great. I like that way. I'm visualizing my own pricing page
as you're speaking, so this is excellent.

That's great. One more
question I want to throw out at you. Because a lot of folks have, a freemium. And I hear in conversations is that the approach to freemium,
like, is kind of all over the place. So in your opinion, how
and when does a free tier really work? And what do companies get wrong
or right on their approach to freemium? Yeah.

I mean, this is a really big topic. So, there's the like you said, there's
lots of different ways of dealing with it. I think what I'll start with is
I see a lot of sales led growth companies try and switch to almost like a product
led motion freemium. And I think one of the big things
people miss there is around this idea of how do I get to value as fast as possible? Because if we're going to get people
signing up for free, then we need to be able
to give them something almost immediately, like, how do we,
what is the fastest path to value? And a lot of these sales
led organizations, there's probably lots, there could be lots of onboarding. There could be, you know, data
in ingestation that has to happen.

All these other things
that really slow that process down. And since it's free, the risk like the my return on investment is really
not there in my brain as a user, like I'm not going,
oh, I paid you money for this. I need to get something out of it. I'm like, oh, I created an account like,
that's it, you know? So like, we have to be able to get them
to value as fast as possible. So I, I feel like if you can't do that,
you need to stay away from freemium, at least until you can do it.

Now, on the other side of that,
where I think, you know, it works really, really well
is when you have built in distribution mechanisms into your software,
and that's said is, you know, someone signs up, 
and they can get to value and they just naturally
share it with other people. Like, that's sort of the
the dream of product led growth is that, you know, we have all these people
that are using it. It's kind of like an extended trial. They're getting tons of value out of it
every day. And then eventually
they're going to convert or the sales team is going to see that enough
people from XYZ company are using it, and then they reach out
and do a bit of a fear play to get them all on side
and, you know, rolled into a, a plan.

So I think of the distributions built in, I think you, it's worth the investment. Like it's worth the investment to do it. So one of my favorite
examples of this is Notion. Their free plan. They talk about they basically give you everything
except you can create a thousand items.

I think they call it. And this sort of goes against my, I mean, it's a clear word,
but nobody really knows what it means. So they have a little hover over there
and shows you what it means. So basically anything
you put on a Notion page becomes an item. And this is the only time they talk about
it is in this free plan.

And basically
you can get a thousand of them. And once you hit up against that
then you need to convert. So that to me is more of the
not free forever, but free for a while till you get to value like
until you get to that value then and they figured that's around a thousand
and then then you move into into paid. And so I think those are great ways
of moving people from left to right
in, in, in sort of a freemium motion. So, I'm not sure of that 100% answers
your question.

It's such a, such a wide topic. But I hope that was helpful. Well, that's super insightful,
because oftentimes we're stuck with, like, oh, it's going to be 14 days,
or it's going to be, until you, you know, want to do X,
but in that example you gave, it's someone experiencing value
at their pace over time. And then they're deciding, okay, well, now I'm ready to pay for this
because I have reached a point where I would like to derive additional value
and I'm willing to pay. That's just very insightful,
because I feel like a lot of times, the parameters are a little arbitrary.

Yeah. I mean, free trial, like seven day
free trial. 14 day free trial. Really, really common, you know, builds urgency
to get to value all that kind of stuff. And sometimes you can do it,
but other times you just can't.

So I, I'm a fan of usage based demos
or uses usage based trials, for that reason is because 
I want people to get the value and plus it gives us as a team
a ton of more opportunities to surface the features,
the value, nurture campaigns. You know, there's a lot of things
that can go into it while you have people in the software getting value,
maybe they're just not there yet. Bill, I feel like I could ask you
a million more questions. This has been so great for me personally. And I think our listeners are going
to get a lot of out of this episode.

So thank you so much for your time. Oh. You're welcome. It's been a it's been a it's
been a fun time. Thank you so much.
