next up is Simon harberg who figured out a way to hack the market hello sharks I'm gonna create a product that already exists in the market in fact there's hundreds of them already out there but I'm gonna offer a bit of version of that product but set the price significantly lower than any of my competitors see in this way all the users of those other tools would want to use my product instead what [Applause] welcome to my channel I'm Simon harberg one and a half years ago I launched my SAS product feed I and to be fair I was never actually on Shark's Tank that was just me playing around some green screen to make it dramatic intro but I did in fact make one of the most common ups I see with new SAS products not nailing the pricing let's just take a look so this was my launch tweet the price of my product was set to five dollars a month and the logic being that with a lower price and a better product everyone would want to come to us right wrong and this is bad for multiple reasons feed Hive is a social media marketing tool and even though it's a low touch product meaning that users can sign up for themselves without interacting with the team it still integrates with a group of third-party social platforms bugs and failures are inevitable so we do need to have a solid customer support experience ready which cost money additionally we're operating in a super competitive market so expecting to grow fully organically without having to spend a substantial amount of money on marketing it's just completely unrealistic so in no way no way could we defend the pricing point of five dollars per month per user secondly it just doesn't have the effect on the user that you think think about it if you come across a product and they price themselves significantly lower than all your competitors what's your first thought that is a shitty product right most people just won't believe it when you say your product is also better because it's not the impression that the price is giving though be careful here nailing the right pricing point doesn't mean increasing the price no matter what and unfortunately there are SAS gurus on the internet that will tell you that raising your prices is the answer to everything it's not I've seen horrible examples of products trying to position themselves as exclusive and premium and reflect that by having prices twice as high as their well-established competitors but if their products are not premium which most products aren't in this initial stage this will backfire so here's the way to do this correctly you should use a strategy I call lean pricing which means that you start at a reasonable pricing point a little below your biggest competitors but not too much now you should aim at increasing the average revenue per user by five percent each month until you meet resistance so let's break this down you can increase the average revenue per user by adjusting different knobs if you have a discount for signing up yearly instead of monthly you can lower this discount or you can aim at getting a bit more users to sign up for a monthly subscription instead of course the trade-off here is that it might hurt retention you can also incentivize users to sign up for higher priced tier this can be done by offering more benefits and features or adjusting the price difference between your plans or by adding a more expensive subscription at the higher end to serve as a pricing anger or finally you could of course just plain down increase your prices though aiming at a revenue increase of five percent instead of only targeting the price Bond itself gives you way more room to experiment with your pricing model at some point you'll need resistance which shows as a decrease or stagnation of new sign ups or people playing down telling you that it's too pricey compared to your competitors I suggest setting up a spreadsheet to calculate this effectively in this way you can also calculate how much churn you're willing to accept as a consequence of the price increase while still increasing your overall Revenue all right the next big mistake I see upcoming sales Founders make is lacking proper execution and I bet you've heard this before but maybe it's not exactly clear what people mean when they talk about good versus bad execution let me try to explain one of my favorite books is this one Lean Startup by Eric Greece in this book they describe this model called build measure learn this is a short feedback loop that enables us to create something test it out measure the effectiveness adapt according to the results and then take that into a new iteration and do the whole thing over again in the world of startups good execution means executing this model very well and here are a few typical ways Founders go wrong about this over and over they start here in the learning step and they get stuck here this means that they do tons of research they want to do this just right so they want to back themselves with as much data as they possibly can and most typically they end up overwhelming themselves causing what's known as analysis paralysis and they simply give up long before they even start executing on anything and the biggest problem is they're not researching on their own data they use any public data they can sniff up and they try to incorporate that into a comprehensive long-term plan that they can feel safe about executing but they never actually create anything which makes it impossible to determine whether their idea will actually work or not when carried out in their specific context then on the contrary you see Founders getting stuck here in the building step this one is so so common among technical Founders they get an idea and then they just start building maybe they'll make a few Google searches or read through a few posts on Reddit and if everything looks good they'll start writing some code they know they probably shouldn't because lean but it's just an MVP you know just to get the idea down they thought it would take a few hours but before they knew it they'd been coding for a day a week two weeks a month three months of building and not a single user had seen their solution yet they never moved on to the missing and learning stage and now they're way too far ahead in one specific made-up direction that they haven't validated yet launch day will most likely be very disappointing though there's actually another variant of this that I'm starting to see more and more it's over execution they built then they quickly launched to see if it catch us on and if it doesn't instead of trying to adapt to the results they just start over they built something new so they are iterating but they just only iterate on the build step and when it doesn't give the desired results they start all over until something eventually hits this is not good execution either this is playing the lottery it's throwing pasta everywhere and hoping that something will eventually stick there are some big influencers in the Indie hacker space who promote this idea excessively and I think that's why we see a surge of new Founders trying this approach and sure some people really did hit it hard using this strategy and they're making millions today but I would call them lottery winners it's not an approach I would model most likely it's not going to work that well great execution is somewhere in between these two extremes you don't want a long and comprehensive business plan so to a certain extent you should definitely just throw yourself at it and get started on the other hand you want to do this in a strategic process-oriented way and not just throwing things out there at random so do some shallow initial research search set some initial goals and create a hypothesis explaining how you're going to reach these build something quickly and get it in the hands of users did you reach the initial goals you set probably you didn't either it went above or below your expectations and in both cases you should hold these results up against your initial assumptions now adapt and do the whole thing again this one is super common as well upcoming Founders believe that in order to create a successful SAS startup they have to create something groundbreaking and Innovative because that's how all the big ones started right Airbnb Uber Tinder bolt just to name a few they all completely disrupt the tick and created entirely new markets so obviously that's what it takes to be fair if you really want to build a unicorn and take it public then shortly you probably do need to disrupt the market in some way but if you don't want that if you're perfectly fine with building a small SAS that do a few Millions a year then you don't have to be discouraged when you go on search for your great idea just to discover that it already has huge competitors in fact that's a super good sign it means that there's a big Margaret for this and that users stand in line for solution to the problem you're trying to solve you just saved yourself a ton of market research and initial validation right there though I totally understand how this can seem discouraging vdive is a social media marketing tool and there was a handful of huge competitors around already not to mention hundreds of small competing products yet feed I was doing great we have more than 10 000 users on the platform and we're turning over more than three hundred thousand dollars each year and we're growing with around 10 to 15 every single month we're stealing users from our biggest competitors every single day because they're old and clunky tools built on outdated Technologies and we simply offer to solve the same problem but with way less friction and with the ability to adapt way faster to new features and changes on the social media platforms and a lot of users are more than willing to change to our solution because of this so don't be afraid of existing markets and big competitors unless you're sitting out to completely disrupt the industry take it as a good sign that you're on to something all right the next mistake I think we're all guilty of but it's super important to be mindful about it it's staying within your comfort zone and working on the easy things this means different things for different people for developers and product Specialists this means constantly optimizing the product they tell themselves that if they just add one more feature or make this thing a bit faster probably users will start coming in deep down they probably know that what's missing is good at marketing but that will require them to get out of their comfort zone which is hard it's much more convenient to just keep doing what you're already good at it could also be designers who keep redesigning the landing page or polishing their product trying to make it more shiny and more attractive while perhaps the core of the product really isn't that good it doesn't really solve the user's problems well it could also be the marketer who keeps optimizing the funnel keeps running new tests keeps trying out new channels and creating complex multi-channel retargeting campaigns while the product is neither looking good or solving the core problem well but that will require looking into product development and learning some coding which is complicated and hard staying in your comfort zone is never the solution and with today's tools and the information we have available there's absolutely no excuses for not doing the hard things if you're a developer you can learn marketing just Open YouTube and get started if you're a marketer you can learn enough programming to build something really cool with the help of no Code and low code tools and if you're a designer you can learn both of these there are no excuses here though if you really feel like moving out of your zone of expertise will be counterproductive the solution is to go and find a co-founder to cover you don't fall into the Trap of Outsourcing the parts you're not good at it's a trap I can almost guarantee it but if you can find a good co-founder that get the same stakes in the businesses you have you can definitely make it work that way as well so this is the last and probably one of the most persistent ones believing that you don't need marketing and that a good product sells itself I don't know the exact statistics but my impression is that founders of SAS products are technical more often than not and Technical fan owners often have a huge barrier when it comes to marketing their products either there's simply two products Centric by nature which makes perfect sense given what they do but I've also met technical Founders who carry a sense of entitlement when it comes to marketing they're typically the kind of people who hate being marketed at or sold to and they somehow feel that marketing is beneath them in either case telling yourself that you don't need marketing is the one and single perfect way to set yourself up for a huge failure with the rise of NOCO tools like webflow bubble sap hearing libraries like react Tailwind chakra UI and so on it has actually become really easy to create great products so everyone's got them now if you think your competitive advantages is a better more high quality product think again because almost everyone can create one of those today what I don't see that often are SAS founders with a clear-cut go to market strategy their distribution channels nailed down and a plan for scale and yes I'm talking about an actual long-term strategy here not just we're gonna launch on product hunt this is much more rare but I can guarantee you that these guys are going to win even if they have a shittier product than you I can honestly say that I've been guilty of these mistakes as well and the most annoying part is that once you start changing these and you start seeing better results you're left with this subtle feeling that you kind of knew all along admitting some of these mistakes for yourself is actually quite harder than simply recognizing them and thinking that they make sense and that's totally okay it's all part of a process my first attempt at launching a SAS product failed miserably I made all these mistakes the second one was feed High the one I'm still running today and in this video I'm gonna show you how I took it to a thousand dollar mrr in the first 30 days and how you can replicate it by doing three simple things if you enjoyed this video please give it a like
