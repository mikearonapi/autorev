of people don't know what their willingness to pay their customers are and they feel like they're trying to figure it out but I think you have to remember that if you don't know what your customers are willing to pay for your product then at the very least you can just you can ask them you can go ask them what would they be willing to pay for it and you have to put a little bit of a I guess a skeptical lens on that when you go and ask them because the information you get is not always going to be perfect but it's going to be much more helpful than having no information are you a scaling SAS founder ready to make the leap from leading a team to Leading an organization join us each week as we refill your think tank with actionable tips and strategies from great business Minds you know and those who don't know yet this is SAS fuel with your host five-time entrepreneur SAS founder and Globe trotting Adventurer Jeff mes welcome back to the SAS fuel podcast where success like great coffee isn't about how fast you brew it's about the craft the consistency and the people who keep coming back for more more anybody else a coffee nut and that is one of my favorite things I'm your host Jeff Ms I hope BB sass Founders like you grow from traction to scale here growth is more than just numbers it's about crafting a futureproof company premium valuation and leaders who build a business of significance while living epic adventurous Lives why is it that some companies charge a premium and do extremely well While others underprice themselves into Oblivion uh spoiler alert it's not about the actual value of the product it's about perceived value pricing isn't just about covering cost or following industry benchmarks it's a strategic tool that can dictate how customers see your product how much they're willing to pay and even how fast your business grows get it right and you unlock profitability and Customer Loyalty get it wrong and you're stuck in a cycle of discounting churn and Miss Revenue opportunities that ain't good for nobody so this episode we are diving into the science and psychology of pricings we're going to fix that we'll unpack why so many

fastrowing tech companies with over a decade of experience helping companies monetize their products effectively James is here to share actionable strategies for aligning pricing with value avoiding common pricing mistakes and driving sustainable growth welcome James Wilton hey James welcome to SAS fuel hey Jeff good to be here thanks for having me today is all about pricing and psychology is a really important part of that tell me a little bit about background and how did you get to where you are today in regard to pricing yeah yeah it definitely wasn't a straight line Jeff and I think it's true for many people in in pricing it's not people don't tend to start their careers being off I want to be a pricing expert just it finds you if it's going to find you I think but I got there through management consulting really I've always been a Management Consultant of some form or another I started my career about 20 years ago but I started off in sales and marketing work and doing a lot of strategy and Ops and then I ended up actually getting into pricing because I was about 2 years after business school I was at a big firm called at KY and I had my first kid and I suddenly went from the situation when I was traveling 4 days a week but that was okay cuz my wife and I would hang out on the weekends and we' just concentrate on getting our work done in the week to a situation when I wasn't seeing my newborn kid except on weekends and it was it was just I wasn't living my values it wasn't what I wanted to do yeah so I was in this bind because I really liked Consulting I like the variety and the way of working I didn't really imagine myself getting an operational role but I knew I couldn't keep doing this so I was conflicted long story short I ended up getting getting head hunted by this internal Consulting team for a big company called relx or Reed El as it was then and this Consulting team focused on pricing strategy and the idea was that every time one of their businesses needed to do a big pricing model change they would bring in this internal Consulting team and they would help them do it so it was still management consulting it was focused on pricing strategy which I hadn't done anything of sounded fun and it would be be a lot better work life balance for me I'd be able to be at home a lot more I wouldn't have to travel I ended up rolling the dice and as it turns out found that I love pricing it was way more strategic and had a lot more room for creativity than I think I thought it would from the outside looking in and I was hooked and I spent about four years with that team before deciding that I wanted to go back into external Consulting but just focus on pricing strategy and that's what I've done ever since really a few different roles but at first I built out a pricing practice at a boutique consulting firm called SBI then I went to McKenzie and I was brought into McKenzie to lead the pricing service line for fuel which was the part of McKenzie that focused on startups and SAS and other fast growing tech companies so at that point i' done a lot of SASS and software work there but I got really deep into the into the Venture ecosystem and working with gross stage companies doing that and then in about 2021 much as I loved Mackenzie and I lik the way that we were doing the work I increasingly found that clients didn't love our fees there were very small companies who McKenzie budgets are tough so I decided it would be really great to build my own consulting firm focused on pricing strategy that wanted to work with this sector of growing companies and kept the quality of work super high at that Mackenzie level but just was a little more flexible in terms of arrangement so that we could actually work with and help the companies that I was interested in working with that's been What I've Done ever since we've grown pretty rapidly and yeah hopefully hoping to be the go-to provider for companies in this space that's outstanding and I love that a lot of companies do turn to consultants for pricing maybe because we're too close to it or it is a little bit black box it's one of those things that just happens and there's a bunch of magic and we come up with a price but don't necessarily know how I think even Smart Companies can fall into that trap of not knowing how to price things and just best guess what are some of the mistakes that you've seen companies make when regard to price yeah absolutely I and I agree with everything you just said that Jeff I think it's pricing is it's difficult right and it requires it requires you to get into a specific mindset and have a particular set of experiences to do it well and also it's very risky if you get it wrong and I find that a lot of growing companies very early on in their tenure they'll bring on like absolute best-in-class product people and then they'll start to bring on really good sales people and marketing people and build up that until you get to a certain level of growth it is incredibly unlikely you're going to have somebody on your team who's an expert in pricing strategy and who knows how to change a pricing approach and what to change it to and how to do all of this and I think that's why companies tend to reach out to Consultants because they don't have the expertise in house and because the consequences of getting it wrong are potentially so severe not to dissuade anybody from making a pricing strategy change but it obviously can go quite wrong and there are lots of mistakes that you common mistakes that you see especially early stage companies do I probably won't be able to go through all of them I think we probably need a few more hours I think like a couple of big ones that I see are firstly not aligning the pricing strategy with your business objectives I think there is a it's a really prevalent belief within SAS particularly I think that if you are selling to a particular sector or working with a particular type of customer there is a right way and a wrong way to build your pricing if you are serving I don't know you if you're if you're serving Enterprise Pharm itical clients there is a particular price metric you have to choose there is a way of structuring your packaging and that's not the case right there are certainly there are conventions and there are things that are seen more frequently than others but really a lot of what should drive your pricing strategy is what you're trying to achieve if you're a company and you're really focused right now on building a good base of volume with a view to monetizing later then the right pricing strategy for that and pricing strategy not just the price levels but the structure around it as well is going to be very different from if you're really looking to maximize revenue or maximize profitability out of the gate if you're just defaulting to what everybody else in the space is doing you're effectively pricing for somebody else's objectives you're not pricing for yours so it won't necessarily help you get to where you want to be going so I think that's a big one makes a lot of sense yeah another mistake I see quite frequently and this is probably an obvious one earlier stage companies tend to underprice their products because they're often looking to gain traction and they they don't necessarily know what it's worth yet and I don't think the overall sentiment of that is wrong it's definitely true if you're looking to build volume as we just talked about then pricing on the lower side is going to be is going to ultimately allow you to build volume better than if you were pricing really high but I think the issue is that you can box yourself into to a place where you it's very difficult to raise your price later on because people get anchored to what they're paying yes so if you're providing a certain amount of value and you're charging silly numbers just for the sake of example $100 a month for it then if you lat to decide on that actually this was actually worth $500 a month when you try to make that change even if technically it should be worth $500 a month the C the company's got in their mind that I'm paying $100 a month for this amount of value that is the right price for that amount of value and it becomes very difficult for you to raise it up whereas a simple fix there would be to say when you do the initial sale we are building a product here that we think is ultimately going to be worth this much right now it's an MVP we haven't built out our entire feature set yet so we are going to discount it by x% at the moment and give it to you for this price right now and then at least in the back of the customer's mind they know that they're getting a good deal right now but they know that the pathway is to increase the price up to where they should be getting to so that can be a helpful just to prevent yourself from having difficulties down the line and is that something you think they really hold in their mind discounts are used in some I don't know weird ways or i' say it's worth this much but here's your actual price is that something you think that they hold or is that something that they look at that and they go okay this is really the price is what we're paying and all that other stuff is just fluff to make me feel like I got a good deal that's definitely probably going to be in some cases you feel like sometimes it is fluff when people do this a lot of times a lot of times it's fluff so I think it definitely could be seen in that way but there are a few guidelines that you can follow to make not seen it that way I think a a there's something about the level of the discount right I don't know you imagine if you go on Amazon and you get you see this like Nic looking watch and it says MSRP $1,000 but it's a 95% discount and you can have it for whatever 50 right your alarm Bells Are Ringing there this is not really worth that much you're just trying to make it seem like a good deal so I think if the discount is absolutely crazy then you're going to be suspicious but usually you wouldn't be doing that you'd be thinking more of a sort of a I don't know 40 60% or something if you were truly early and you aiming for something higher so I think that's key I think second thing to your point Jeff yes this could all be forgotten after the initial the initial proposal right so yeah the good thing about SAS products is you don't just sell them once right you sell them to them every year or whenever the contract renews so you can keep calling out what the list price is and what the sort of the discount is for to remind them and that's helpful when you're renewing because let's say that the list price was $300 per month and we're selling it to you for $100 per month and there's a discount from that the next year it might be$ 150 cuz we built out a whole bunch of stuff and we're walking you up on this this Pathway to get you to to the right price level so you can you can refresh the messages and I certainly wouldn't be the person to suggest that any of this is Trivial the exact messaging the way that you convey it is all very important but of course frankly that's that's something else that we could probably spend a couple hours talking about as well oh easily and in Psychology is so much of that and that's exactly what you've been talking about just how to position it how to message it and then aligning that that pricing with perceived value rather than actual value we talked about that before just the importance of making sure that perceived value is there what's key to understanding and influencing that perception in SAS yeah absolutely yeah to back up I guess for for anybody who hasn't heard things talk about this I always say that actual value really doesn't matter that much when it comes to to pricing which sounds super provocative right but it's really just the fact that what does matter is perceived value which is the amount of value that the customers can see within your product and you can't just assume that they're going to see all of your actual value just because it's there you have to be able to show them that and I think especially with startups and early stage companies there is so much value that's lost because we didn't use the right messaging to be able to talk about the the product so a couple of examples of how that might play out right I have actually worked with companies believe it or not who really they know that they create value but they don't really have a massive understanding of what kind of value it is for the customer they know the customer want it and they're willing to pay for it but they don't exactly know the details why and I've also seen companies in that space when they they almost don't want to go and find out because they're afraid of being found out right if I don't understand why you value my product how does that make me look obviously if you're not able to know how your customer gets value from it you can't talk about it you can't reinforce it there's no way they're going to be able to see all of it right certainly not consistently second thing is you might understand what kind of value that you are providing them but you're not able to quantify it I can say that this product is going to help you generate more revenue and then the client says how much if you can't give an answer and say how much then it's hard to back into really how much is worth for them right we know there is some value there but we don't know how much I'm going to guess good chance I'll understate how much revenue growth is possible there and I'm going to end up being I'm going to end up seeing less value than there actually is is there and it's even true on a qualitative basis as well I find that a lot of times when companies are building out their products and they get very excited about building certain features and capabilities which we think are going to be like incredibly important and transformational to the customer and that's great but rather than going to the customer and saying are these the things that are the key things that you think about when you're choosing between vendors or you know you want to buy something they just assume that it is so all of their messaging is built around our internal assumptions about what is valuable and impactful to the customer rather than telling the customer the things that they want to hear so if you're speaking one language and they're speaking another language then again they're not going to be seeing all the value that is in your product and they're probably going to end up underestimating it and brings down their perceived value of course brings down their willingness to B I think that happens a lot because we're really familiar with our product and we know all the value in there and we think all these features are great and we just assume that they have that same knowledge which is not the case at all but just being able to read them and even just in in pricing you underestimating what that the willingness to pay is exactly I think that's a a really tough thing and thinking about is in comparing to other products out there and we set a price and we I don't know if they're willing to pay that or not or to think about raising the price what's maybe some misconceptions around that leaders have about customer willing to pay and you know what that is yeah exactly no that's right there are there there are a ton of misconceptions around here and I think the point you just landed on Jeff is super important because a lot of people don't know what their willingness to pay their customers are and they feel like they're trying to figure it out yeah but I think you have to remember that if you don't know what your customers are willing to pay for your product then at the very least you can just you can ask ask them you can go ask them what would they be willing to pay for it and you have to put a little bit of a I guess a skeptical lens on that when you go and ask them because the information you get is not always going to be perfect but it's going to be much more helpful than having no information and actually I would say with certainly with a lot of new companies when you've built a product that customers are excited about and they they really believe in it and they're champions for it and they'd refer it to their friends if you go and ask them what they'd be willing to pay for their products there's actually a very good chance they will tell you that they would pay more than they're currently paying I actually have a really good example in this most of the time when I do pricing research for companies we do so in a what's called a double blind way right so it means that when we're doing the survey the respondent of the survey doesn't know who we are who we are working on behalf of so they don't know which company they are they are talking about and also the client that we're working for can't see the sort of the actual responses for each individual customer or kind of attribute them to any particular people so that allows the people who are like taking the survey to feel good and safe about sharing the the information because it's not going to be used against them not in not individually anyway and of course the from the client side the customer doesn't know that there that this information is going back anywhere so that's the way it's usually done it's more expensive to do it that way because you have to go and Source these panels and so forth so sometimes like the slightly less theoretically good way of doing it is actually approaching customers or buyers saying that you're working on behalf of this specific company and I did that once for a for a company that had this SAS product that basically allowed you to to collect market research data basically like testimonials and ratings from customers that you can put on your website and show how well-liked you are and we surveyed these guys knowing these customers knowing that we were working on on on behalf of this particular company saying let's say you bought this particular package how much per month would you pay for it the results that came in would say that like all of these customers on average would pay at least 50% more than they were currently paying for this product because they could see that there was a huge amount of value there and they were happy to be paying extra they wanted to support them so there are definitely cases where if you're charging a really high price and your customers kind of resent having to pay so then if you go and ask them how much they would pay for your product they are probably going to lowball you but it is not the case in every single situation and going out that and getting that information is always helpful I like that and I love being able to do that where it's not here's the product and what would you pay but that's one of the real benefits of working with a company like you is having that third- party research to do that where it is a little bit blind I think you get a lot more honest information that way yeah exactly it's definitely the best in-class way of doing it because you know that there's no say there's no there's a lot lower chance that the customer is strategically inputting numbers because they want to they want people to think that the willingness to pay is lower than it actually is when you do it in that way yeah I think the founders a lot of times will set pricing just based on gut instinct early on y what's your advice over time transitioning from founder Le pricing where we start to something that's more data driven yeah exactly I'd say my first thing my advice is like transition from what we talk about like as being founder base pricing as soon as you possibly can because it really doesn't take a it doesn't take a lot right you don't necessarily have to do an enormous survey and do tons of research or anything I would say some Market data is better than none I think actually a really humorous example in a way is open AI recently right Sam Alman he and open AI they launched their pro version for chat GPT which they were charging at $200 per per month right and and of course everybody's reaction to that at the beginning is like oh wow that sounds like a lot but then he posted about it recently saying basically saying that ay I made up the $200 per month price point and B we're losing money on this because of the amount that people are using it when we are selling it to it so that's founder based priceing there wasn't really a lot of thought that went into setting that $200 a year price point and I don't think there would have had to be a ton of uh diligence RIS really that would need to be done to be able to flesh that out a little bit really looking at usage patterns across across customers for your usage costs so if you're assuming that a certain number of customers are going to be using it at certain levels you can probably figure out what the cost of that package is going to be to you yeah and also some light willingness to pay research as well again doesn't have to be extensive but just getting the idea for these companies for these these users who are really high usage do the van westendorp approach right what price would be what price would be a bargain what price would be expensive but still worth considering what price would be too expensive to even consider and for other examples maybe not for this one right what price would be so cheap that you'd start to question the value of the product there you can do that for just a good set of your customers you have a really good range to work within and you can pick a price point which is going to be a price point that people will pay and if profitability or like at least covering your cost is a goal you can probably set the price within there that is going to make sure that you stay whole I think that's really good thinking and I love the example because I when Pro came out having conversations with people I'm looking at and thinking that's a steal I think that's fantastic and then other people like $200 that's 10 times what I'm paying now that's so much I'm like okay but just the different reactions to the exact same number I think you know really knowing your ICP what is it that they want to do how Are you delivering value and I look at that $200 a month that's it's nothing compared to what it can do and do the work of a couple of people and so other people we can expand our team we can take on a lot more business without having to hire a lot more people there's just so much value in that and other people look at it is it's 10 times what I'm paying today for just a little bit more incremental value exactly the perception yeah prec precisely and that Insight honestly Jeff that that is why I would go as far I'd go as far us to say that the most powerful principle in all of pricing strategy is price differentiation right which is basically charging different amounts to different customers based on the differences in their willingness to pay there's there's so many studies been done I've even got examples within my own work that just like simply taking like a kind of a one-size fits all this is our product take it or leave it and just creating tears from that the impact that makes to your revenues and your profits is just massive because then you're able to bring in those kind of lower willingness to pay customers at a slightly lower price point that gives you profits that you otherwise wouldn't have had and revenue you wouldn't have had and it allows you to charge higher to those customers who would pay more and would be willing to pay more than that other thing if you just have a one option you're just picking to the middle which is why I think that a what really makes a great pricing strategy is having that what I would call a price structure it's the system that allows you to scale your prices to customers of different size type needs Etc and packaging is one way of doing that and then what I'd call your price architecture so you know your price metric and the way that it scales the price is is another it's a way of using those things together to get to different price points based on these different willingness to pays but then in order to do that as you started to hit on you really need to know your customers you need to know your customer segments and how these different customer segments what their needs look like what their buying preferences look like and what they're willing to to pay is and if you can understand that at a really deep level then you can make a pricing strategy which price is perfectly is too strong but price is well to each one of these different segments and that's how you

we'll definitely talk some more about that but you mentioned like pricing metric or value metric to base pricing on how do we pick that where it's the right metric it's a lot of times historically it's been seats or usage based pricing has started to take off and that's all some sort of value but sometimes I think that's all made up too how do we identify the right one for our specific product yeah exactly can I start with what you shouldn't do please you probably done it loads of people have done it honestly I think the thing that you shouldn't do and I alluded to this earlier is that you shouldn't just pick the sort of the default knee-jerk metric that everybody else is using there is still I'm going to muck up the exact number but I believe that still about 40 45% of B2B SAS products still use number of seats or number of users as their predominant price metric sure now I don't think in the right places there's nothing wrong with seats as a metric sometimes it is I would feel very confident in saying that seats is not the right metric for as many as 45% of SAS companies definitely not because really what your right price metric should do is it should help you price price differentiate and if you want to price differentiate you need to charge differently for people with different willingness to pay for your product which is going to scale with differences in Perce value for your product so in order for it to be the right price metric for you it has to be a metric that aligns to the amount of value that a customer gets so if you're in a space where the amount of value that you get is going to be dependent on the number of users who are using the product then users probably is one of if not the right price metric for you to do because that is going to align with it often times however it isn't always the case that as you add users you get tons of extra value imagine if you were imagine that you were buying like an accounting software and you have a CFO and maybe you have an analyst to to support them right like you get tons of value from that first user right like you need that in order for it to work but do you get a whole bunch of extra value if you have an extra user there if you have two maybe you get like a little bit maybe now you got two people but you don't get double the value certainly do you and certainly if you then started scaling beyond that then it wouldn't work at all because there's probably nobody else in the organization who is going to use it but it might the software might scale the value of the scale might scale with the amount of Revenue that's running through the books right or the number of deals that they're processing or something that really does inform what they're applying the accounting software to and therefore how much value is there I'm not saying those things definitely are the right metric I'm just saying I think that line of thinking to me is more value aligned than thinking about users in that case but there's a lot of those softwares which are still priced on number of users and it's because it's a throwback to the early days of software pricing when you install everything on desktops and you have number of of CDs so I think that reason is one of the reasons why you see a shift uh away from user based pricing another reason in today's world actually is that we have a lot more automation now apis and so forth and it's possible for for a single user to do more whereas you might previously have needed three people to do a certain job maybe you can get away with one person doing it now because of all this automation so if you are pricing based on number of users then you might now expect the number of users to drop over time certainly not grow because people aren't going to be adding users to cover the job they're just going to be able to do more with less so it's going to it's going to shrink and you actually you see a number of companies recently have been pivoting especially now that all these AI functionalities are coming out because it's disrupting and it means that this kind of the seat based pricing doesn't work as as well as it did anymore probably zenes is a great example of that right used to start used to price based on number of users within the customer support space but because AI is coming along and the the automations are taking a greater portion of the support calls they would know that pricing based on number of users doesn't make sense anymore timately erode their revenues so usage based pricing is often somewhere that people go to but again you have to pick the usage metric that aligns to the amount of value that you create it's not just simply about about picking a usage metric and I think one mistake I'm seeing in in gen products a lot actually is that people aren't thinking value when they're thinking about the metrics that they are using they're thinking cost because they're thinking at the moment we're in the situation when J is so expensive for the vendor that I need to make sure that I cover my costs and I don't become massively unprofitable so it's very if I just find the metric which aligns to how I incur costs then if I set price on that then I make sure my costs are covered the issue is that the metric that the metric on which you incur cost isn't necessarily value based for the customer again right I mean think about think about something like I feel like I'm always picking on chat GPT pick like a co-pilot or a chat GPT or anything in that kind of space that's this kind of like personal assistant type approach you are going to in chat GPT is going to incur a cost every single time you ask a question to the system right every time you do a prompt and you get a response it's whirling away in the background and giving you stuff so there is cost that's happening there right as a user you do not get value for every single one of those how many times have you worked with a chat gbt right and you get to a you can get to some really great answers at the end of it but you might have to prompt and refine like 20 30 times right so the value comes from all of that activity together it doesn't come from each individual prompt right so if you're charging a lot for every single prompt then a customers are going to be unhappy because they feel like you're nickel and diming them for something that doesn't give them value and B worst case they may even start to second guess whether they want to do the prompt because they're not sure whether it's going to generate value or not so you end up bringing your usage down because people are not I'm much sure there are ways that you can control for that slightly through the architecture which is like the way that you scale price with it so you can make it flatter and make it so that the price per prompt or per transaction goes down as as you get up to higher number of units but still that's the fundamental challenge it's much reduced if you can create a metric which better aligns to the value so in that case that I just gave you I would suggest maybe a better metric would not be the number of prompts but would be the number of kind of working sessions right if I assume that all my prompts within a particular feed within a certain space of time are going to be towards getting to a certain answer then if I'm lumping all the queries and the prompting within that activity together is just kind of one unit that's probably quite value align for me and it's not as cost aligned that's charging for every prompt but as long as you price it the right way on average it probably is right because you're going to know on average for most users how many prompts typically result in an answer in a session Etc so that you can set yourself up to cover yourself but that's it really I think oh sorry go ahead Jeff that makes a lot of sense in doing that where it really is a line because you're exactly right if I have to pay per prompt I'm out after three or four tries and hey this is not working or then I'm reluctant to use it because every time I don't know if I'm going to get value and I know it's going to cost and so then that usage goes down so it's self-defeating yep exactly same kind of thing there's a video generation tool I was trying out last week and that's how they priced it that was the price metric is you had so many and it was it started kind of premium and so you have 100 generations and I'm 25 Generations in and having to iterate and it's not quite getting it and this and that you get 25 in I give up because it's just I'm going to use the 100 and maybe I'll get a couple of things that are useful but it's just a waste of time it's just not aligned with what I need and the tools aren't quite there see the same thing in CRM if it's priced per contact some people like that I can't stand it because I want to have a lot of contacts in there I want to be encouraged to add more contacts but if it bumps me up from this tier to this tier just because I added another thousand people to my list that's it's not a great value for me because now the price just went up went up a ton that's it that's a great example as well honestly of these kind of usage based or capacity ones and it is interesting right because I think Contex obviously does add value to you right like it's more valuable to you if you have 2,000 users in there than if you have sorry 2,000 contacts in there than if you have a th000 contacts but it probably doesn't have twice the value you probably rather do less that so I think with these if you are doing tiers and you're changing price based on something like that like the real way to do it is to make sure that you do monetize those step changes but you monetize in a kind of a non-aggressive way that doesn't put people off I would suggest again you can tell me if I'm completely off off base here I think let's say that you are operating with a, contacts per month for a long time and you're paying again $100 a month for this for this PR right if you then added another thousand contacts and they said hey Jeff by the way your price is now $200 per month it would probably give you pause for thought you'd be like do I really want to double my price to have these extra contacts in there right maybe I should take some out you unless those happen to be incredibly valuable contacts you're going to really second guess it I think if you put in those extra thousand contacts and they said hey Jeff you put in extra thousand contacts we need to now charge you $120 per month $125 per month yeah then you're probably thinking there is some extra value in there I wouldn't pay this seems like a reasonable small but meaningful upcharge to give me like literally twice my number of contacts that sounds okay and I'm in so it's not just about the metric it's about how you scale the price with the metric and of course as with anything we all are program to expect volume discounting so we're going to expect that the price per incremental unit is going to go down as you add more and more that makes sense what's your take on I mentioned premium or trials things like that pretty popular in SAS product Le growth they're not always effective what's the biggest Pitfall that companies face with fremium and how do they avoid that yeah yeah know premium is it's a it is a really powerful tool if it works and obviously if you are doing product Le growth it it's definitely one of those strategies that fits very well in there I actually think think I did a study recently where found that most of the companies out there that are doing product Le growth have some kind of free offering within that and I guess for anybody who's listening who doesn't understand what product Le growth is super quickly in traditional models we had sales Le growth where it's basically it's the Salesforce who are charged with acquiring leads and and nurturing them and bringing them on and ultimately converting them in product Le growth it's all done by the product right so it's basically the product is going to pull people to to the website educate them nurture them and then ultimately allow them to transact and get onto a product just all through the website and we're seeing more and more of those kind of models as as as the technology enables it really like it's more viable to do that kind of thing now than it was previously but I think within fremium in there like the principle like the way that a fremium is going to end up working for you is if you can get enough free users onto your platform and the amount of those free users which you are able to convert to a paid user like the extra the revenue that you get from that conversion step and from the upsells thereafter if there are extra sips has to S outweigh ideally significantly outweigh the cost of having your free users on that platform and I think there's a few things that are going to make that are going to make that true and viable right one is you have to be able to serve these free users in a relatively inexpensive way right if you're going to rack up a ton of cost for every single free user that you are bringing on it's going to be very difficult for that to make sense so if you have a product where there is a lot of setup required or custom installation or there's a huge usage cost between doing what you do reality is it's going to be very difficult to make that work I think you also have to be able to create a very valuable free product so that those they're going to be free users who are never going to convert from free users and you have to accept I think a lot of people make that mistake right they kind of see the free users as being a bad thing and we need to get them alter paid in order for a premium version to really work you need to have a portion of your customers who are going to buy the free and are going to be absolutely delighted with it and are never going to ever want to upgrade ever and that's great because those users then be they become champions of it they love it they will attract other people to the platform and they'll pull them all all in so you need that but then at the same time time you need to be able to set a value threshold on that free version so that all the users who are at least capable of getting more value out of the product have to be pushed onto that paid version and I'll say the mechanic of drawing that line really difficult right because it is it's like how do I make it so that it's great and valuable but it's not going to be enough for a good meaningful portion of my customers and I think the art of Designing a really good premium strategy is that really it's like where do you draw that line I Think It's Complicated by the fact that another thing is you need your first paid level within your premium approach your first paid package has to be priced quite low because it's a lot easier to get people to pay more once they're paying something than it is to get someone who's paying nothing to pay something you want that kind of first threshold that they cross over to be relatively low and then you can pull them up into higher price levels through your other mechanics of your of your of your model that's really yeah exactly so you have to be able to do all of that really and I think the last thing is something a business has to have for this whole sort of premium and funnel type approaches there has to be a lot of users potential users out there that you can reach so that you can get enough people onto the platform so that you get enough people onto the paid versions initially just to make the economics work and that's really it really means that your product at least the value at the user level has to be sufficiently Broad so that there are lots of users out there that you can attract through that way so if you happen to have a product which is extremely Niche and there's only like the users of this are very specific tight in in in individuals where it's difficult to identify them and it's difficult to Market to it to them then that kind of product Le approach is never really going to make a ton of sense right it's going to be far easier for you to go through for a sales-based approach and find them and Pitch them and convert them yeah think about that fre I think it's really smart to have that free to something paid and then I like that just the psychology of once they're paying something it's easier to increase that how many tiar do we need like I've seen the common thing is good better best one of the crms I was thinking of a minute ago I remember looking at it and they had eight pricing tiar I'm looking at like I don't even know next yeah so how many tiar is right how should we think about that exactly I'm going to give a really good typical Consulting answer of it depends for this one James it does depend a little bit I would say that eight is the amount of times that eight is going to be the right number of tiers is going to be very small portion of the overall pip I would say like that feels like a lot to me but there's definitely cases where fewer is better and there's cases where more is better and I think the what would dictate it would be a little bit of the Dynamics that you're you're selling to if you're selling to Consumers for example consumers need very simple pricing strategies right because they got they're not going to go in and in general spend a ton of time researching and weighing up exactly what they want they're going to go to a pricing page they're going to look at the options they're going to quickly make a assessment about which package is right for them and they're going to end up picking those so if you end up with eight tiers with that kind of situation that's going to make them more likely to not make a buying decision and they're going to go they're going to go away right it starts to feel too complex for them but then there are also bio segments you might be doing plg and premium strategies too that can tolerate a little bit more complexity I would say that prosumers or small medium business type buyers you can't think of them as Enterprise buyers because it is more that you're selling to a specific person and psychology matters and they Crush for time it's not like they're a procurement person who can like really think through all the different options there so they do need Simplicity but they can probably handle more complexity than can a a consumer plus also there is there's more value at state for you in terms of price differentiating on those SBS than there is on a consumer because say that although you're going to have different consumers with different willingness to pay there's probably not going to be a massive range in terms of what one consumer will pay but a small and medium business who could be buying something the small end of that could be like literally two people tiny business mom and pop right and the large end of that could be 50 employees right so you I don't know what the price metric is yet or what the thing is but I can be sure that company who's got employees is probably going to be willing to pay a lot more than the company who's only got two so I have more of an incentive to create more levels of differentiation there so that might produ that might push me to create more tiers it might also mean that rather than creating more tiers I scale the price of these tiers by a certain metric that's the thing that a lot of people forget that you can do here right is that you don't have to just have a flat price for a tier you could also say that this tier is priced per user per a thousand contacts per whatever it is right per a certain number of transactions so you can start building that complexity into it still keeping it transparent and simple enough to be able to work with that particular segment but making it monetizing enough to to work all the way through so I guess bringing that back to the eight users to the eight users to the eight tiers I could maybe there is a situation out there where you need that level of granularity and perhaps I haven't seen it if there are if all those tiers are incred well defined and the difference between them is super clear and it's it makes it very easy to navigate that maybe that could work as a gut reaction eight tiers feels like probably more than you would ever want to put on a pricing page it was something I was definitely interested in and just the pricing was confusing so I moved on and bought something I understood yeah and so you know it it didn't work yeah so finding the right balance so if you were to create a say simple three-step framework for SAS Founders to rethink their pricing what would that include oh yeah great question so I think first thing would be starting with objectives as I said I think think about what are you trying to achieve with your pricing strategy very strategic high level here not just in terms of pricing think about what are our business goals over the next two to three years that's usually a good window for thinking about a pricing strategy right two to three years assuming you're growing what are we trying to achieve are we prioritizing Revenue growth grow versus volume growth or is it like Revenue growth with constraints on on on volume whatever it is try to really nail down what that is and prioritize them because different pricing strategy elements are going to satisfy different objectives and if you haven't got the prioritize set of what is most important what is next it's going to be very difficult for you to evaluate the trade-offs when you start to do those so I think that is step one I think step two is really understanding your market and how your product and how your Market thinks about your product so getting some doesn't have to be heavy some light voice of the customer doing some interviews maybe doing a very light survey just to think understand how the customers think about value right what scales the value for them right is is it that I get more value with more users do I get more value with more context try to think about what those potential value scalers price metrics could be and test those with them to understand that try to understand how much complexity they can tolerate as well do they just want you to tell them exactly what they need to buy and they will buy it or do they want a couple of simple options or do they want a lot of customization and control right across that you do that research and you get really good data across all of those different those different segments you might be thinking about fantastic Bedrock for your for your pricing also I think within that i' put it in the same bucket is getting some kind of competitor research in there as well really understand what your competitors are charging what their price structure is what they're what they're offering within those different things how their sort of product Compares you don't want to be copying your competitive pricing but you know that your prices are always going to be compared to theirs so you have to make sure that it stands up relative to them right like when they think about your value relative to your competitors are they going to feel good about your price level and the way that you're structuring it relative to what your competitors are charging and then the last thing is really I think once you've got all of that information you have a really good set of information to base a pricing strategy so then you go and you make your pricing strategy decisions and I would I think you have to think about packaging and price architecture together so again packaging tiers or different structures price architecture what is the price metric or Price metrics and how are you scaling them you have to think of them together because choices that you make within packaging are going to impact the choices that you can make within your architecture for example like if you go to eight tiers on on on packaging you probably you've got to be very simple in terms of the architecture because if you start adding complexity there then it's like you were already put off by the eight tiers imagine if you had to navigate all that as well likewise if you go quite complex on the price architecture you need to keep your packaging simple think about those and it's really going to be all about what is going to be the best mechanism for me to PR to price differentiate across my customer base once you've got that you then want to be just setting your price levels for every every level of your of your architecture and your packaging which is really going to be applying that data that you got for Price setting to the structure and getting you in a getting you in a place where the price levels you're setting are going to be helping you achieve your objectives we talked earlier about are these going to be price levels that maximize volume in which case you want to be pricing towards the low end of that van Weston do range are they going to be maximizing revenue or profits in which case you're going to be pushing much much higher that's so good I love the Simplicity of that framework that is something that anybody can do just that very practical and I would add a fourth one to that and that is grab a copy of capturing value a very approachable very good pricing book or pricing pricing guide pricing just the way to think about pricing tell me about the capturing value and how would you describe it yeah no absolutely yeah thanks for bringing it up Jeff but capturing value is it's a book I've been working on for quite a long time I've been working on it for about four years right and it's I really wanted it to be a reference for a certain individual that I I keep seeing across many of these growing companies as I mentioned to you earlier right I'm frequently see you often don't have people within these companies who have experience in pricing but they do need to change their pricing at some point right the pricing that got you here is not going to get you there and so what usually happens is like the board or the CEO or something says to one of the executives hey by the way you need to create us a new pricing strategy now and this person has no experience in this space so doesn't know what works and what doesn't work I don't know if you've taken a spin around the internet for good guidance on SAS pricing but there's a lot of stuff out there it's not necessarily super useful it could be could be misleading could be wrong so that's tough and obviously the consequences of getting it wrong are pretty severe and if you're the guy who's got to do that then that puts you in a really difficult position I feel for these people who are put in this position sometimes they get access to Consultants Tolo and help and that's great often times they don't have budget so what do you do so the idea is that capturing value is a book which can take them through through the entire process of doing this it breaks down what you need to think about for pricing into different chapters there's theory in every chapter theory is Theory we want to be practical but you need to get yourself in the mindset within each one of these areas you need to understand the philosophy within each one of these areas understand what your options are the pros and cons and then think through the steps the Practical steps that you need to take in order to build out what you should be thinking about within those so really if you were somebody who needed to build a pricing strategy and you read capturing value from front to back you did all the exercise and you came out you should be in a really good starting point to be able to have a new pricing strategy on the table outstanding and it is I think I said pricing Book pricing guide because there is it's step by step guidance in in kind of building building your pricing model how to think about it how to implement that how the packaging so it's a lot more than just pricing so you get what metrics to to track the packaging those kinds of things but it's very approachable and I think that's one of the things that really differentiates it from some of the other books out there they're very theoretical or just here's a bunch of theory but it's not the stepbystep here's how to go do this and that's one of the things I really like about the book Thank you thank you no I'm glad I that's certainly that's how we hope to to design it wanted it to be usable by by by people so I hope that that comes across for the readers out say where can people learn more about you online and where can they get a copy of captioning value absolutely so you can learn more about me personally online at my LinkedIn profile which is James
