nobody knows what the model looks like we're all guessing when we guess the model there's obviously Blacklist but that doesn't tell you anything really that tells you if it's on a blacklist it doesn't tell you what the model is right don't blame people in your company you want to blame the process the only competition you're really seeing is yourself really a lot of ways welcome to the go to market podcast in this episode we're joined by Jesse uette from lead magic who is going to share insights on cold email deliverability and the evolving landscape of email Outreach you'll learn about the critical changes in email deliverability as of October 2024 the importance of building a robust monitoring system to prevent inbox burnout and strategies for effectively reaching Enterprise clients using Outlook Jesse also discusses the significance of using multiple email vendors and the impact of Demar records on your Outreach success this show is brought to you by lead bird a lead generation agency specializing in performance driven hyper-personalized cold emails that generate demos and drive growth go to lead bird. to learn more what's going on guys I got my boy Jesse here from lead magic I've know Jesse for like I think three years now we've been uh on top of a lot of the the cold email stuff that you'll see like the influencers post because they'll see us talk about it initially they steal our stuff but we don't care whatever yeah yeah I think Jesse is the way I describe it is he he's definitely growth hacker he's has a great background from going from like sales leader to kind of like deliverability consultant to like agency owner and then now killing him with the SAS space and that's stuff we'll talk about as well but I I think uh the the most insightful things I get from Jesse are just like all the cold email deliverability like ran into little nuances that you won't like it's just like technical stuff like the very very very technical things um that Jesse's just been able to like pinpoint really well um and so whenever I run into issues that bird I I love calling Jesse and being like hey did you figure this out how' you solve this and he usually always has an answer uh so to go ahead and cck it off Jesse a lot of things have changed in the last year on the deliver body front what do you think are like the must doed as of October 2024 that you need to do to get to the primary yeah so I think what's really changed is the the service the where the in the UI ux where the user hits report is spam they're starting to bring that more to people's attention right and that is the everybody knows that's the Fatal uh that's that's the that's the kill shot for anybody sending cold emails right so if you hit report is Spam I mean that's that's the end of your day right like you got to go home at that point right so uh you know you're only allowed really a very small number of those and that's why of course A lot of people are failing now is they sort of send annoying messages right they're not relevant offers they're not picking the right audiences they're you know they're they're picking maybe 50% of the right people and 50% of the ones that aren't but that is all the impact in the world that you need to be thrown out of the uh inbox now and you know I had said this like four or five years ago uh when I started really on this like journey of you know B2B like email delivery I started saying like hey everyone's G to be screwed you know and I actually was even fired at a company where I said hey I'm not going to put on the email signature and that was like the last Rodeo I had in SAS so I you know I saw it was coming though I knew it was going to come I knew you couldn't really just put a bunch of images and a bunch of links and a bunch of you know so you really H it's now it's the really the only thing now like we're even I mean people aren't even really T you know I still see some people kicking around like oh here's how you write great email you know like but that's that conversation is like kind of now it's more hey how do I build an infrastructure that I can actually get these messages out there make sure they're relevant and you can't you really can't spam people now right the the servers are way better way more like they're using a lot of tactics I mean you know that obviously they would have with machine learning cloud computing AI right like they're they're able to really detect a lot of this stuff and they find you pretty quickly and they block you so I think what's changed the most is just the fact that now it's not your it team is part of your sales team now if you're not if you're not from that department and and what would you say like okay like I think and it's always funny right cuz like me and you know what's up I think a lot of the high level guys know what's up when it comes to a lot of the technical stuff but you always people like the guys that are just getting to the space they make content about the things that are kind of like I would say fundamentals and Basics and so you know if we go to the fundamentals it's like you know no links no attachments no open tracking um short sweet copy that's spin tax really well um you know using providers like Google and Microsoft not going through resellers um you know making it to where it's very low email per inbox and per domain it's making sure you have like the regular dkm record set or like the regular uh record set up right that's like the basic fundamentals outside of the fundamentals what are you thinking is like you have to do these kind of things to make sure you you land in primary I'll tell you what it is even and you've probably been humbled by this before too I would say one of the biggest ones and I can give an example here of something we just ran into um but the biggest one I would say is setting up consistent monitoring and building your organization for failure and what I mean by that is before the failure happens it's better if you just say it's going to happen right because what happens is it becomes a blame game like who didn't do this and then it just tears apart the team right so the way that we take anything into you know even in suffer I mean it's a little bit better in software development but uh in in sort of email you have to build it the same way the infrastructure has to be built the same way with failure right you have to be thinking about like Hey we're gonna what happens if this stuff kind of stops working or this or whatever and if you don't build a monitoring if you don't build like all that you can make some really like just stupid unforced errors but you have to to build a really good organization and you've built an amazing agency and I wasn't as that wasn't my strength but uh you know I I would say that you have to basically don't blame people in your company you want to blame the process so like when something does go down right like you you know hey we missed dkim records on these you know nine domain names 10 domain names like don't blame the actual person who was setting it up more blame the process because there was obviously you should have had a check there right you gota as an agency owner or founder you really got to blame yourself and say hey we should have had a a test case there that's testing it every week I mean we we email ourselves for every single inbox we have for every week right and we know if the records are ever off there's an alert that's s it right yeah and I think I think that's that's a good point as well I think yeah to your point like literally we built the foundation this last week of like how to identify when an inbox is going to get burned before it gets burned right see like that that trending effect you didn't see replies and you look there's a little bit of a a gut feel there but like there really isn't in a lot of ways where it's just like hey we started this campaign it's been three four days we've sent it to a couple thousand people doesn't look like it's hitting we're not seeing any replies the replies that are coming in are like take like harsh like take me the F off your list your you know go eat concrete or or cinder blocks like those types of ones right uh but like that's what I'm thinking is uh really you know if you don't see that happening right away then there's something wrong or even the ones that are getting no responses are are like just as bad like no response now especially with you know I mean you really couldn't do open tracking it was really compromised for like a year and a half really before so people thought they were doing it but they weren't so um but anyways that that's sort of the thing you just have to plan for that and you have to look at like I like to look at the initial you know I get a little nervous after that first th thousand to 1500 emails if I don't see at least a you know some some people who read the message clearly in the message like in their response it's clear they read the message yeah no and I I agree I think like whenever we see a campaign where we're not just seeing because I think like and here's the thing right like a lot of the new guys it's easy to monitor whenever you're just doing a couple campaigns when you're doing it for 50 to 100 clients a lot that's hard and that's where you got to build a foundation where you're able to like kind of identify these Trends yeah we did a lot of I mean for us it was about um so it was like first of all it was it was like a people thing first right you start with like people and you're like all right here here's the things that you you personally are responsible for right very clear goals there very clear like written like written down everyone knows where it is and when it say responsible I mean like you know monitoring it right uh and you should use technology though to monitor everything you're doing in your company for that for that matter right like you know I had a good one today where uh where we were you know there was like a couple of inboxes we had that were sending a it was an internal campaign but we were running the campaign and it was uh still sending but it was like we actually had somebody come in LinkedIn and said hey uh you know your inbox didn't I tried to reply to buy or whatever they were trying to and it didn't every agency own knows what I'm talking about they've had something like this and you basically realize oh crap there's something going on now it was like one of our tenants and it was not um for some reason like the card had expired or something like that we've all had that happen and and what what ended up happening was it was still sending emails right even though it was now I think that's a testament to how great smartly it is and still sending the emails even though that but I'm just surprised that it would still work right like that's that's that that's the thing it's like Microsoft when they disable the tenant yeah they seem not to disable the outgoing SMTP but like yeah your inbound Emos anybody that replies immediately disable or like they just get that bounce back that soft bounce yeah that it was like this person got like a Del like uh there was another level of bounce that they got back and that's it really is is like just like that internal campaign you know you're like oh man how long how many you then because the worst you start thinking about the worst right yeah it's like oh like this has been running like this for like months at a time I mean quite literally we this is when may be like two years ago we had a situation where we had all of our clients in one tenant like an idiot and it got disabled and I think we had like maybe like two or three tenants that were using at that time so maybe not all the clients in there but we had a huge like maybe a thousand plus in boxes in that one tenant got disabled and then we didn't recognize this for maybe like a week yeah and so now you know you can run yeah it's really hard and you got to kind of figure out the technical way to like figure it out and the way we figured it out was like okay if you do a daily check on the domain for Microsoft inboxes in a tenant and you can go check to see if the SMTP is connected or not Y and if it's not connected that means that the uh the tenant is probably disabled right and so that's how we're we're how you want to do it yeah um that check was now that check is now in place for us so yeah yeah yeah I agree I think like I think like the way it is it's like yeah you have a process but you should always have some kind of tech on the back end that can verify that hey that it or like you know identify whatever the trend goes down yeah and if you look at the if you look at like the best organizations in the world the ones that have been around you know like US Navy like any of these like really you know organizations that have just been uh you know reliable right like I mean the airline industry things like that is just they have they have a process and what they do is they just they look at every single failure and they adopt when something happens they never go and say I mean they might have to eventually but like that person really is a you know because it kind of breaks it actually stalls you from getting to the problem you're better off going to I mean look the person's under stress they're working at your company it's probably a fast moving company like that's the answer to just about every you know they have a life too that that's the so you can't really just go blame and attack the person you're better off trying to figure out like what happened in a nice way yeah and be like oh cool so we could just prevent that from happening with this strategy now right so how do I get that information you know that that's the kind of conversation that I'd say top agencies as you know and I know you guys do a ton of this do that right like that's a big um you know just just testing constant I mean we're testing all of our SAS applications every API m point I have we test every single uh 15 minutes we're testing it yeah oh to kind of shift the conversation a little bit you know um one of the things I think it's very important going into 2025 like this is how the landscape for cold Emil y I think like the best way and the best agencies and and just the best people doing it in the space you know they're going to have multiple vendors and multiple providers when it comes to emo infra so like going every everything from like just regular Outlook regular Google to hyper tie to mail Reef using a whole variety of vendors uh on the back end and then you know you use a tool like need magic for example to to examine the the MX records of every lead on your lead list and then you create the campaign you're basically adjusting who who you're sending to according to the info that best can inbox in that in like in that receiver's inbox yeah you that yeah I mean we saw so we did some really I saw really like we all saw what ha what's happening right now with and it's might just be might change you never know it changes every day but we're we're all seeing like how hard it is right now to get your emails into the Microsoft Office system right so I think what we're seeing though on the other end I think there's probably a good reason why Google might want your emails actually because what they like I think if my guess would be is your interaction with Gemini right being inside their platform I think they probably want you to tune your own spam filter right which is a better world for them anyways right spam filters are are are are just as annoying for the email providers themselves because they have to basically deal with the support right the support of spam filters is hard right they have to predict what you don't want and when you get something you if you miss an email that's when they have to jump in and that's when it's expensive and it people have to get involved so I think Gemini might have a good reason right now and you know if you're looking at it and that's why what we're seeing is if you're sending Val to valid emails and I'm not talking about like like the the famous accept all catch all valid emails and we we find those too but it's like if you're sending to truly valid emails the ones that the the MX record says this is a valid email right the except all is controlled at the Domain level what we're seeing is like almost a 4 to 5x reply rate on a similar campaign if you're hitting on Gmail valid emails because it's it's obvious why right like you can hit you know and when we did the placement testing with uh VAV uh on Smart lead we we saw a Hu it was just a completely dramatic change like it was not even clo it was on a I think it was 10x difference when we saw like compared to Microsoft Office so I mean valid emails on Gmail right now seem I mean that that's today we could have this interview next week and be a completely different story but that's where people are sort of seeing a little bit more of success and getting out to a good start getting engagement high in the beginning seems to be the most important factor yeah I agree I think like inbox burnout is is a real thing and like the and and this is why it's so important like when you have a client like you try to make that first campaign be the absolute best y because like the least amount of Engagement or the lower amount of Engagement you get the the higher chance the inbox gets burnt out so I guess like I've also thought of like and I love your opinion on this some like I guess like kind of gry hat black hat like warm-up strategies in this this sense so you know the campaigns that do really well no matter what is like you know the ones that you target International companies first and and you know they just obviously do well because they don't get pitched as often as Americans right um I think think that does really well in terms of getting engagement is like this is a little bit more on the grayer hat side of things but like emailing people pitching them on hey um I'd love to or you know we're currently hiring and we're we're looking for candidates we thought you'd be a good fit for the role like would you like to send over your resume or something like that or would you be interested like everybody's looking for a new job in the market and it's even more internationally like they are all looking for more jobs and they're more lik to respond and and you know hear more about it this this is funny because if you think there's another there was another service out there um you know and I think they had pretty good intentions actually I really I actually do like the founders and everything like that uh company called gated I don't know if you remember this one do you remember these guys yeah yep I do so so the funniest thing about that whole company was I you know what they were doing was they would basically you'd send an email to somebody like a senior level uh executive who has this gated on their box right and what they would do is they would reply to you with a link and the donation button right now that to me is like whoa I just got to reply you know now it's an Engaged domain I could do I and it's to see you know it's somebody who's been on that that tenant probably since the beginning or is like you know has maybe even cred like higher level privileges like you're now getting an email for somebody who might have a billing account on there right like that's a pretty good person to get the email from and now you're in now you're in you don't even need you know so it's like um I know they they unfortunately didn't didn't seem to make it but you know that service itself really didn't understand that if you are engaging with people's emails and you're you're trying you know you kind of don't really win if you you know come you know go out spam with Spam or something like I think that's like the but that was like an interesting one just not understanding how the internet works like it it look you can't like mess it like it's it's a you know it's it's Glo and the reason that it works is it's not owned by one country you know like there's a lot of reasons that were set up the way that networking and all the interconnectivity and all the different like nonpr even domain resellers or or domain companies registered and then obviously IP uh you know the ipv4 and all that like understanding that at a fundamental level sort of helps a lot with um cold email yeah know I agree um what are your thoughts on like how to land instead of like an Outlook inbox like let's say you're you're eming like like yeah so Enterprise or you know 80% of your lead Lage Outlook like how would you go about getting those to to actually land in those Rees so the ones that we're seeing we did a bunch of placement tests now this I don't love this answer because it doesn't really help but the ones that we saw that had the highest reply rates on on an Outlook system was it was the ones that uh okay so we looked at a couple things one of them was we looked at um we looked at if it had uh like the older domains did better so the ones that were over a year old now that kind of stinks because a lot of your you know if you take on a new client or you're an agency you're going to have older you're gonna have newer domains so that might actually bring the uh and I know you've talked about this a couple of times uh you know you might want to possibly uh you know set up a system where uh you know you're using more generic domains and you might use that domain again with another client or whatever right like it's sort of already warmed up or whatever pre-warmed or whatever you want that's sort of into that space right I don't think people necessarily notice the um there but I think the other thing that we noticed uh with Microsoft Office was we were able to get better replies early but then it would like fade off really hard and you just like oh my God I'm not getting anything in now right did you see that is that what you saw yeah no exactly and that's where it got harder I think any of so any of the ones that have like security gateways even made it a lot harder so obviously like if somebody has proof point they probably still have Microsoft Office right it's not that they don't have Microsoft Office they have so that's one thing we've been doing in our platform we've been giving the DNS records to to basically help people and then we've actually been seeing uh there's actually a pretty good thing I'm doing right now I'm looking at the SPF record and the Demar record as also indicators because think about it logically like if somebody was if somebody has like an Enterprise DeMark service like a Dem Maran or one of those a lot of those are going to be um more you know they're going to be harder to uh you know they're going to have much different kind of policies on their systems internally so I think uh that that would be another thing um you know for that and then I think low volume right now seems to be uh you really got to go like even like five to 10 emails like you got to be very low and uh you know looking at some of these services like um scaled M and sorry what's the other one hyper tide yeah so like those ones right there uh you know I think there's a couple of these that are out there right now that if you know you know kind of thing and uh that's something that I think you might want to look at uh and I think you know getting into different groups I mean here's the thing at the end of the day if like everybody uses the same platform uh we also did a little bit better on office when we turned off warmup yeah slightly better it wasn't a lot it wasn't enough and that was on we tried it both on instantly and smartly just we try to you know I'm try obviously like um you know I do help uh smartly you know full disclosure I do help smartly I'm an advisor with with v but also like I like to try to sort of like at least try both platforms just to see if I'm ever if it's ever that uh because I think generally the user base is pretty pretty close I think it's the same type of user right so I think that's what it is versus like U some of the other tools um that I've seen yeah and what is like I know you mentioned this in one of the group chats we're in so when you look at like a Demar record and like they have like jacked or quarantine on there like how do you kind of think about those and if you should email not yeah so that so the way I think about it is I'm like all right so if somebody's doing authentication on their domain on their email they're probably it jumps one more step for me mentally it's like if they're doing if they've got you know flattened SPF records that's probably a dangerous one to go after because you're probably going to look I mean it's not that they're that like cutting Innovative like company that that's like doing a lot of them are just blocking everything that they don't know right so the first thing you're going to look at a lot of the time is what domain is it right that's going to have the most carry on it right like if you think of we don't and by the way nobody knows what the model looks like we're all guessing when we guess the model I mean there's obviously Blacklist but that doesn't tell you anything really that tells you if it's on a Black List it doesn't tell you what the model is right the model that the companies the spam filters are using is totally they don't tell you anything right in fact they would never tell you anything because they don't want you to abuse it so I think what you got to look at is you got to look at the model like what would they be looking for so Demar records there's uh obviously there's Enterprise Demar companies so I think if you go if you were thinking about it in your own way you probably want to Target companies that don't have as um uh you know they're using their own domain as a Demar record and they're they're using none or reject I'm sorry uh none or quarantine not reject so if they're using reject they probably have a pretty stiff policy that's actually yeah know there's also another one uh there's another setting uh and I'm trying like I'm still AGG there's a lot of data here that I have to go through before I even tell people something because I I test I I don't I don't want to ever and I never will so like like if I say if I say it I have a lot already behind like the the testing and the methodology and I've tested it at like a pretty high volume so I I already know like you know what I mean like I I don't I don't throw it out there if like I haven't tested it and I would love for someone to challenge one of them and then let's see what happens because it would be a bad day for them I think so so uh you know like and I don't go out there if I if I really just don't believe it but I think anybody who has like a strict SPF record on a stricter uh Enterprise uh DeMark is going to be a problem and then the bigger companies obviously ones that have sensitive sort of like Financial Service or like uh you know insurance or like those types or like your sort of like government you know you're going to have a hard time they're just going to block everything I mean the Strat it's it's the ones who have very high investments in cyber security and like pen testing and those types of things those companies are going to have a much different profile the the local businesses are going to be a lot less right like those ones are I mean you could probably even get a reply on a role based email on those right yeah no I I I agree so you know and I'm not saying you can just change your ICP overnight right I'm not telling you to do that but I'm saying if you're an agency and you're trying to figure out who the hell to take on as a client uh you know it might be a good idea to validate like you know try just put put a hundred of the the the target companies through our validation of like you know an email or find an email there and then just go let yourself you know see what it does I mean you probably want to check and see because if you find out they're all on security gateways they're all in like you know proof point or something like that it's probably not I don't think email is the best strategy for you you might want to make some calls you know if that's what you're into and then or you might want to do some more like you know LinkedIn prospecting and that type of stuff yeah and and and that kind of Tes me to my next Point yeah like what what do you think of LinkedIn Outreach right now uh so you know I'll just disclaimer it because obviously like I have a good relationship with LinkedIn but I I don't uh I don't do any like automation on my own account or anything like that ever because you can always get they have a really really they have a lot of people in their abuse team and everything but uh you know I think LinkedIn does work very well for prospecting because uh you know but you only get a certain amount of connections a week right so you're limited to that and you know let's say 25 days a month you might get a a you know 35 to 40 connections a day like at you know there used to be a way to kind of go over that like 500 but those are the old days but the you know the big thing is there is really just getting the connections but then making the Curiosity Gap so high on the profile like don't don't put any messages in there don't do anything like make sure they're coming to your profile to try to figure out what your company does yeah no I I I agree and I think like um like how I see the landscape changing right so if you kind of think about it five years ago or not even five but really like three years ago it was super easy to to spam LinkedIn you had you know High sending limits you know you could load things up you can run it for super cheap and send out a t messages for super cheap now they've made it so much harder to send messages you don't even want to risk your own profile like it's not worth it for your own for your own you know if it's one of your salese I don't know like your whatever your markeet I don't know whoever it is but um they they've limited everything on there a lot and and and it's the reverse for cold email like cold email used to be expensive it used to be harder then you had tools like smartland instantly that just revolutionized the game made the cost to actually send cold emails way cheaper to the average person and now you know you're starting to see you get it TI it over there I think LinkedIn is going to make a huge comeback for agencies in in 2025 uh versus they are I'll just tell you like on LinkedIn like they are exceptional at detecting automation on there right uh from all angles and I and I've looked obviously I'm uh you know I have to be an expert in these these areas this is my profession and I you know obviously I would tell LinkedIn that right like and and when I look at like what they're doing I mean they you you know first of all browser based automation right not that you know you'd be crazy to do any browser based automation like what I'm talking about is a plugin right and what people don't understand from plugins is they're actually they can actually see everything in your browser they're very dangerous to install right like it and and it's privileged at a certain level and Google did not have a good handle on this they're starting to get a little bit better but most of those browser plugins are completely compromised on all levels and uh it is Extreme like they can detect every single browser plugin that you're running on LinkedIn yeah so if you're running any if you have any browser plugin they know exactly which browser plugin and it's very easy to do there's it's not hard at all they just basically send they send you a a list in your browser like you might you don't know where it is but it's in your network traffic they send you a list of all of the all of the the the um extensions that they view as uh dangerous for their platform like sort of you know it's a billion dollar Revenue a year right sales navigator that just the it's it's it's their you know that's their bread and butter right so like people that go after that it's a little bit ridiculous like you know they're they're gonna they're gonna fire back right just there and and that's why like I just laugh people and then there's the other group of people that uses tools like you know they'll use like a tax hour like a phantom Buster and I think that's okay fine that works but it's like if you don't know what you're doing there you could I mean one time you're you're done I mean they they could like yeah and then you're like did jail and you're calling around yeah and like if you're selling in B2B it's it's definitely not worth it like I think you know the when you're doing any kind of cold prospecting the the bridge you're trying to Gap is that trust bridge and so it's like you know if I look you up and I can't find you on LinkedIn to me that's like oh this might not this person might not even exist and then it's like yeah you know here's your account to do anything probably not the the best idea so try to find the workarounds around that uh we're not GNA really mention how that happens but yeah yeah try to the works and the other thing that's happening there that's interesting and interesting kind of topical is if you look at what happened recently there's been a couple of interesting ones and I don't know if people know about this but you you look at like um and I I think this is you know I actually don't I'm not like they're a competitor of ours but like I still don't you know this isn't I don't love this situation either like I think it's kind of they've built a pretty good product and you know maybe maybe there should have been another warning but they're removing companies that are doing it so like the their biggest uh asset is obviously like you being on a social network that you can you know network with business professionals but that what they do is they end up taking that from you so if you look at uh prosio recently had a had a little bit of a problem because they were they had a plugin I think that was scraping LinkedIn sales Navigator right and so they they've removed the founders of prospo and they've removed the company off of LinkedIn uh you know what I mean so there's I mean there's 's a lot of tools that are scraping LinkedIn right like that are doing different you know things that are you know at the same time it's it's just one of those things and I I watch that and I'm like oh wow this is interesting but um I don't know if you knew that but that it's just like kind of a crazy situation where they're you know that's their target move and it just shows how much how valuable that platform is for Distributing content to people in business so be careful there yeah yeah easily um I I'm excited to kind of talk about like what you've done on on like lead magic specifically right so like yeah for everyone like you know I'll kind of give you a quick glimpse of like how lead magic has kind of transitioned and like where it's at now and and it's exciting to see because I see it being mentioned way more now than when I knew you yeah so when you first started you were doing company enrichment and then you kind of like the agency on the side kind of under the same umbrella and brand and then uh you kind of I think earlier last year you transitioned a little bit more into like the Sass and the done like do it-yourself model where you're kind of supporting a lot of agencies to pull in like client reporting and just kind of being on top of smart lead and now it's starting to become a full-time like email verifier email finding tool and and to kind of give you your your your prise it's you know world class it's it's finding more most tools it's verifying emails than most tools and actually coming back with accurate data and so you want to kind of talk about like yeah so I mean I was getting a little frustrated what was happening was we were we were kind of split between two different things and I said I gotta either go one way or the other and and I decided to go uh all in really on the SAS uh product really and but I also realized the one that I was doing when when I was uh I was I was challenged a little bit I couldn't get the Val and look I think there's people that have done it even better than me since since then but like I couldn't get the value proposition over people where it was like all right we know who's on the site but it's Anonymous and like that now we were doing account level and I don't even want to get into like account versus identity level like it's it's not really a big it's sort of it's sort of I almost get like a head a popsicle headache whenever I think about it but the uh what I realized is I just needed to start and we launched the new platform like kind of like to you know monthly subscribers in February and what happened was I said you know what I'm just going to go in I'm gonna help people with smart lead which is what I'm good at I'm gonna help that I'm G to build a WhatsApp group that people come into uh and get information and then I'm going to do email validation right and I'm just going to try to do it as well as I can do it and just see what happens that started to go really well we started to see a pretty good increase in subscribers obviously I had a little bit of an audience so it was a pretty good uh pretty good natural there wasn't going to pay all the bills but then what happened was um you know we started to realize wow it could though if I do it a certain way so we just made it incredibly useful we we we let people kind of do their smart lead uh some we we had some like things in there to help get these this sta in Year campaign then we got to email finding there was already already a lot of vendors that do this I started to see some Trends where I could I got really good at building uh apis right like API development API gateways uh sort of that type of thing and I realized how to do it a lot less for a lot lower and a lot better and that's when clay started to hit so we got pretty fortunate there uh we got into the clay app store they were they were nice enough to let us in but we were in 12th Place uh on their waterfall which is a which is quite a ways from the top right and then they redid the math and they realized wow this is probably the best one of the top two three Tools in in this platform and they put us at number two uh and you know I still think we're the number one but uh we're also half the price but I don't want to go there but uh and you know I think it's one of those things like they've realized that and you know they've been an amazing partner we've been really happy with them and then also I've just been continuing my relationship with smart lead and you know V obviously we both know him pretty well and just really trying to help people more than anything really and then we've just kind of we've done a lot of different things like Hey how do you enrich a LinkedIn address to uh or like a sorry like a business address social media address to a uh to an email or a personal email to something else like sort of that but we do it with compliance involved and things like that and we're getting into these kind of clay ecosystems and look I'm just uh you know I keep my cost look we we we have to compete against companies that have raised it's countless it's like 40 50 million and I'm just like man if I even had like you know one you know one or two Engineers extra like I could but I could get that right like it wasn't going to be hard to raise but I wanted to try to do it this way I worked at a lot of companies that I didn't really love the culture of I just it didn't work for me very well in my profession I didn't want to build that type of company and fortunately we were able to get out of the gate pretty quickly I think it was a lot of like just helping people really uh good making good relationships getting on you know events like this and helping people in The Pavilion and the different communities that I was in and just help I literally I just started said I can't I can't take anything here I got to just help and and it worked in that sense and you know we're we're doing very well really like and you know bare metrics and stripe and all of them put us in like the 1% of growth in their their platforms and you know it's kind of a cool cool chart to look at every day and I'm pretty happy with it and we're really all in on that now so yeah no it's exciting to see um and I'm curious how do you think about going to market for like a plg SAS like lead magic yeah I think well you know look I I think first of all you know when we send emails it works still because how good we are at like keeping the cost down you know how good we are at like all of the like Logistics around it we had that business so that's fine so we do that however the other thing we do obviously is like LinkedIn and sort of like uh you know Partnerships with I you don't have a lot of opportunities to do Partnerships when you're an early stage company and I think you got to match pretty closely to the group that you can help right you know when I look at all these platforms out there I started to say like who could we work with and and I started to see a lot of these kind of clay experts and some of them um I think probably maybe were like a few years uh you know behind of like where maybe I was at at that time and I started because I used to use like Google Sheets and air table to do the same type of stuff and I was like man this is a group I could really help and the tool is actually much easier to use right so that's what I think you got to do some Partnerships there but I think it really comes down to like you got to be just so hyperfocused on one group and for me it was like I just built a uh you know a WhatsApp group and it's caught some virality in fact there are you know even smart lead and you know some other companies have said hey we've grown significantly and just you know I'm you know humbled when they tell me this obviously maybe they're just telling me what I want to hear but I don't think that's the case but but basically like a lot of these places have you know it's this kind of dark social strategy of like going into certain real time groups chat chat groups or whatever and if you know you know right if you know the if you you're in there you see it every day I mean it's it's a busy Place yeah no I agree I think like the the communities online if you can find your corner they're so bad like I think you know where I got a lot of my early growth was you know one in your group but also just on Twitter like find tter Twitter yeah and and kind of look at that's I mean that's how you you you found me y then brought to the group and then you know started posting content in there as well but I think yeah communities is a very very very underrated strategy for a lot of like PG companies I think the other thing to is like you know a lot you know the the best you the best thing that could happen is like you know you build an integration um or or the company you know integrates with you that's bigger and they have you more of an audience and then they you know push you in the email newsletter but no that's not always going to happen um specifically for like newer startups and so what I think is is a smart way to kind of get that integration to go both ways is build it on your end with the expectation of nothing ever happening and then go reach out to to the the founder of the other company say hey look I just built this integration for my customers thought it might be useful for you guys as well and see if you can integrate on your end um let me know and and I think that works out really well I think uh a company that did really well with this is like Lis kit for oh yeah they're brilliant they've done a great job integration with lead hit up smart lead and guess what now they're in the smart lead like app if you go to Integrations they're the first thing there totally and and you know smart leading the size of smart leading the traffic that they get like that's just free publicity for for liset on the growth side yeah it's it's a lot of that and then like uh the other thing is is that's interesting is like uh you know especially in and you know you like you know I started to what I realized was when I was doing the email and I started to build a little bit of credibility in that group and I had credibility across a lot of different um kind of niches against that right there was a group that sort of like you know had like copy down right you know and I had that group because they really needed to get some content and I think it like when I was in B you know when I was in sales earlier in my career I was like you know winter takes all kind of mentality I think what's happened now is I realized the only competition you're really seeing is yourself really in a lot of ways and if you network very well right like I obviously we got connected you know years ago but like it's just a matter of like wow how do we keep this Rel you know keep these good relationships going I know we've met like going to that smart lead event and things like that I mean that was a good exclusive event then you know I talked to obviously Daniel and like anybody else who's in the you know in that in these groups you kind of know each other and you can you're only like one quick message away from somebody right and that's what I tried to build in that syc is like I knew you know when I see these like pockets of you know people that I I I have I align with core value right like inside I could see myself partnering with them in a you know I trust them their business you know they're they're they're like positive people they're rational right like they're not like let's go do this it's going to you know like they have more of that growth mindset uh you know business and I think those are the people that you can really add up you can exponentially grow by surrounding yourself with people like that and that's what I tried to do in the last year and two years really more than any time right to to kind of pivot a little bit um you want to kind of tell everyone how you went from and I'm actually curious on this as well how you went from like being a sales leader so like kind of really teaching yourself all this and then teaching yourself how to code and then building your own s CU you know you're like what I would say is the main developer and like the main leader on the technical side at lead magic but you want to kind of talk about that because I think that's insane like I mean I think I'm a little bit more techy than most but I'm nowhere near the level of like development that you can do um but yeah do you want to kind of talk about yeah I think for me it was like uh so re uh you know I was fortunate uh my parents sort of got me into technology early and uh I had that but I never really I started out like thinking I might maybe I want to go into engineering or Compu science I realized H this isn't really that fun I'd rather be on the business side and did information systems but then I just always was very technical in nature of everything like I always like knew ways to solve things with technology but it was more of a systems level and I didn't really want to get too deep into the code code level insights and and what's changed actually and this is what I mean today I was even you know now I do want to get into the code side because it's so much easier with the not that I want to like spend my time Cod all my time coding as a you know but I I can do a lot there's a lot of decisions that you can make to just change your company like code is a distribution model right like you know it's like content and social media it distributes somewhere and it's one of them I mean you know you look at any Nal whatever you know and Twitter right you look at any of these people and they're like code can just get that's why there's so much there and the opportunity is huge it's a literacy thing for the you the upcoming Century here right so it's like it's you have to start thinking of it that way now I'm not saying you have to go in there and be like the you know the best like coder but if you can apply the business model to it and you know you don't I always hear sales people when I was in my career as a sales they always like oh yeah I'm not Tech like they would automatically just set themselves up for failure they would start with words like phrases like I'm just not techn or uh you know like non-technical I'm like what do you like that's like saying I don't read you know like I'm not saying like but you know you hear that and you're just like d like what do you what do you mean you're not like what the world is technology now and you have to really address that problem head on now you can might maybe you say I'm not familiar with that topic in technology but to just sit there and be like yeah I'm just not Tech like I mean what are you doing you're taking an easy you're taking an easy way out right what if you could go in and learn as much about that as you could now I didn't really love the like Hands-On coding right like that is where I got frustrated and it was over my head and I was like yeah I can't do this I can't get these pointers right function but now all the great code is in GitHub so you can just assemble code it's like Legos now you just do that you find your great MIT code and you could be a sass founder tomorrow it's I'm telling you right now like the code is there and in 15 minutes I could I could build you know just about any SAS you could really want right now it's I mean it's it's pretty impressive what's changed and even uh the biggest stuff that's coming right now is is like uh the the like the reets and the um bolts and and uh continue and uh uh cursor all of those like those tools those tools have changed the game completely because even developers that I know that are really good I'll talk to them like have you ever used you ever use it and they're you know when they use those tools they're like holy crap my job is in trouble right so they could get their jobs done a lot faster now if they're smart and they can go get you know maybe build faster and build stuff that people want so I think it's leveled the playing Ground And I remember when there was like a a time when I was in sales at companies and they would say ah can't wait till we don't need you guys anymore right right that was like the mindset of a lot of the engineering teams that I worked with right and I just thought that was such a limited mindset right I was like what do you mean what what about when we don't need you right now I'm not saying it was like us versus them I'm saying the ones that were really great were the ones that saw the value and realized how hard sales was and how hard marketing was and my background in sales right so yeah but you know I understand you know what I think is like and and this is like the thing right I think like um with the the the growth of AI a lot of these jobs are starting to get like the barrier to ENT starting get a lot easier I think like you know it's it's so much easier to develop things um as like like a non-technical person coming in and becoming technical I think it's much easier to do now I think where everyone starts to like kind of fall as like and this just comes from experience it's like you know you have to kind of see a SAS be made so you have to kind of see how the front end is assembled and connected to the back end and then how it's posted on AWS and then connected to strip like you find all these like little in tiny interchangeable things and you do got to see it happened once and then from there it's like you can figure out how to piece it together with you know using cursor or or you know all these different tools that are on the market that have kind of like level the playing field but yeah I think like one conversation I had with uh uh Bruce from cleverly who we were uh interviewing last week was like I think we're going to see the first billion dollar startup that's run by you know one to two people yeah um all that stuff that's happening with AI and I it's crazy to see um yeah it's great and what I'm doing right now like I I'm like how fast can I build this app like let me just see if I can do it and then like two hours later it's like completely built and I'm just like this is CRA this is absolutely crazy and then you know whatever you don't have or whatever you even don't understand or how to build it uh and and that's the biggest thing is like I also really understand the like it side of it the devel you know development operation side of it so like uh what a lot of people don't understand is like all right so if I run a serverless computer versus a a Ser a computer with a um you know serverless computer is something that can run the functions pay by the function right so what I see is like I can take advantage of a lot of uh free free tier stuff right so you know when I look at even uh when I had no code type stuff out there for sale now that I everything I have is now in code I'm just like wow I can get this cost down to like nothing like a $100 you know like just and and I'm not doing like the I'm not necessarily a great like Indie hacker guy that like is going to be at like 50 Mr I'm probably going to be bored of it in like a week if I'm at you know like you see a lot of those you know you have respect for them but you also are like come on man are you really paying the bills with that 50 $50 a month SAS yeah yeah just to just to kind of end off uh to kind of talk a little bit more about lead magic I know we've been we've been rambling for a while what would you say or you know obviously there's tons of email verification tools out on the market like how are you thinking about like how to increase your enrichment percentage as well as like the accuracy on it yeah so we're so there's a lot of things that I'm looking at right now what we've done is first thing is is like I've really figured out so like validating the email first on every email that gets that comes through and then when something does show up as a catchall like what steps can we take to verify that this is actually a real email so the first thing you got to do is you you got to be real about it you you should tell the person what it's it's an accept all email right right and I think I think my competition does this very poorly uh and I would tell them that too right like I have told them that and I think it's I think it's a I think it's laughable a little bit because that that you need to tell people that it's a catchall email address uh because it means that it's much harder to verify it right and what I mean much harder is it could get deleted this week and you wouldn't know it versus one that isn't like it's just older day like you're going to have to use another source right you're going to have to figure out a a uh you know a public space where that email address has been used and you're going to have to basically score on how accurate that addresses and that right there or you do what you know what you guys even do well with you know scrubby is awesome but you know it's a matter of like do people depending on the campaign like are they willing to wait a few days but that's the most I I mean that's the look that is the most accurate way to do it you email them right uh but you know what I mean like I you know for right now we're we're competing in the real- time space where people are doing that we've just really focused on like hey these are the best I'm trying to let them score it's I kind of think of it has 93 uh you know performance oil versus like 87 you might not put in your car right if you're if you have a fast car so I think you got to start with the 97 the 93 oil first you're not going to want to go to that lower uh you know area and look one bounce today like even a soft bounce right the soft bound people don't understand this like a soft bounce is still with Microsoft or Google yeah right like it's it's a hard like they control every email server right so so the you know at the same it's the same it's the it's the same I guess in the older you know what it there was no Gmail or Microsoft Office it was like well who's really checking this out and but when you bounce even if it's a soft bounce on Microsoft it's I mean I guess it doesn't alert the whole internet right but it it still hurts right people don't spell emails wrong or they don't miss you know not a lot of people send bounce emails all day right like very low percentage of Bounce goes through and I think you know look if I had to say one agency that I could talk about that has like un I don't even know how you guys do it at your scale just like your process must be amazing like this is a testimonial for you guys like there's nobody better I can tell you right now and I'm putting on our site nobody better than lead bird in terms of running quality you know campaigns like it it is mind-blowing how how good your your operations is on your agency side I I gotta be very real with you you know when we were talking about a couple months back yeah appreciate that appreciate the love um well awesome dude well thank you so much for coming on it was Diamond chiming about all the stuff that's going to happen in 2025 we're excited to see how this space grows um I want to have you back on in like you know probably like this is great let's figure out and see what what our predictions uh come out to be and then see how it goes but awesome outside of that dude appreciate you for having now thank you.
