## Transcript

I've come to believe that there are
like these three pillars that when integrated and de-risked against
each other create the greatest amount of magic and excellence. And that's people. Product and Go-To-Market. The very best companies, they
have an actual people strategy. I walk in companies, got a product
strategy, a fundraising strategy, but they don't have a talent strategy.

For those of us that have seen
tech shifts or studied them. This one's happening with
more conviction and speed than anything any of us have seen. Don't build for what you can do today
because the world's moving faster. Like you gotta think ahead on this stuff
and you gotta play chess, not checkers because otherwise it just happenstance. If you do tactics and absence
of strategy, probably not gonna get where you want to go.

You gotta follow the money and the pain. If you're gonna have the most performant
organizations on the planet, you're gonna have the most performant people. And if you're gonna work with and support
those people then these things matter. Customer drives everything
in the organization. It drives employee engagement.

It's the one person that
can hire or fire you.
