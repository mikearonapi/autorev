Did you know that the wrong free model could be killing your SAS business? When we analyzed conversion data across 500 companies, we discovered a five times difference in conversion rates between these two approaches. Hey everyone, today we are settling the great debate in SAS. Premium or free trial. Which one will actually grow your business faster? Let's break down the numbers first. Premium typically gets you five times more users at the top of the funnel.

Sounds amazing, right? But here's the catch. It only converts about 2 to 5% of those users to paying customers. Now, free trials, on the other hand, attract fewer users, but converts at a much higher rate, usually between 15 to 25%. That's a five times higher conversion rate than premium. So, which is better? Like most things in SAS, the answer is it depends on your specific business.

Let me talk you through exactly when each model works best. Premium works best when your product has strong network effects. Think Slack or or Dropbox. You have viral loops built into your product. Your customer acquisition costs are low.

You have a clear path to monetize a large free user base. And your marginal costs per user are minimal. On the other side, free trials work best when your product delivers immediate value with an obvious aha moment. You are targeting businesses with clearly defined needs. Your product requires significant onboarding or setup.

You have a higher price point and you need to demonstrate ROI quickly. Now, here's something most founders miss. These are not mutually exclusive. The hybrid approach combines the best of both worlds. You offer limited free access forever to get the wide top offunnel benefits of the premium model, but you also provide premium features on a timelimited trial.

Companies using this hybrid model see 30% higher customer lifetime value compared to pure premium or trial models. Let me give you a real example. Calendarly offers basiculing functionality for free forever, but puts team features and integrations behind a 14-day trial. This lets users experience the core value proposition without time pressure while still creating urgency around the premium features. The biggest mistake VC companies make is blindly copying competitors without understanding the strategy behind their model.

Before you decide, ask yourself, how quickly can users experience value in my product? What's my ideal customer acquisition strategy? How important is user volume versus conversion rate for my business? and what are my margins and CAT targets. Your free model should be a strategic decisions aligned with your specific business goals and user experience, not just what everyone else is doing.
