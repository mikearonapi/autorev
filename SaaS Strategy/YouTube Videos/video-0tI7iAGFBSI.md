are you a scaling SAS founder ready to make the leap from leading a team to Leading an organization join us each week as we refill your think tank with actionable tips and strategies from great business minds and those who don't know yet this is SAS fuel with your host five-time entrepreneur SAS founder and Globe trotting Adventurer Jeff M welcome back to the SAS Fiel podcast where we remix ideas like a DJ spinning tracks from different genres into one hit record I'm your host Jeff Ms I hope you s Founders like you grow from traction to scale here growth is more than just numbers it's about crafting a future proof company premium valuation and leaders who build a business of significance while living epic adventurous lives ever feel like you're playing whack-a-mole with grow strategies you're not alone you know read a book listen to a podcast go to an event hear a speaker everyone has the way and within Industries there's often the way you know maybe a little Mandalorian this is the way but I'll bet when you created your first go to market motion you probably just copied somebody else don't feel bad I did that too and then in the next company I did it again everybody does but we're so often entrenched in our own industry norms and just the way that things are done we miss out on revolutionary ideas floating just outside our little bubble we're stuck in Echo e Chambers recycling the same old strategies and wondering why our growth feels like it's on a hamster wheel five companies four exits and there is one single lesson that really stands out one that I'll rank is my most vital lesson and it might sound a bit crazy but don't look for lessons inside your industry look outside take what works in another unrelated industry and apply it to yours it's cross-pollinate those ideas and watch the magic happen I actually discovered this by accident by complete accident each successive company I built was in a different industry completely unrelated from the last one and I tried the copypaste go to market plan and and you know take somebody else and here's how you're supposed to do it in the industry completes snoozefest yeah mediocre at best which makes complete sense because if everyone is doing the same thing in the same way that's average that's you know the same thing that everybody else El is doing so you get the same result and it's but as I moved Industries I really knew nothing about the next one and sometimes I knew less than nothing so I just used the toolkit that I had and it was from another industry and the crazy thing was it worked and I didn't necessarily realize that I was doing that uh but by company 3 I actually figured out what I was doing like oh that's what it is I'm taking a lesson from over here and applying it somewhere new and once I realized that and knew what I was doing then the more I did it the more I tested new ideas and the better it worked and I got outsized results not average results but big results so imagine this you're a B2B SAS founder like me kneed deep in dashboards and CRM Solutions and then suddenly a flash of inspiration hits you from an unrelated industry I don't know say like a gourmet coffee shop it all comes back to coffee right it sounds wild but stick with me and this you know one small thing you know could be the ultimate growth hack that kept my entrepreneurial Journey not just a float but thriving you know it's about borrowing Brilliance from one sector and then sprinkling it on another like a DJ remix you know when a different artist records a great song for example you have that happen where you hear a song you're like that's that's a different singer what's up with that or maybe in a different style so that's pretty cool too when somebody takes a song and then does it in the new style or you get artists from completely different genres that they'll pair up for a tune so let's break it down here's my three-step framework to turn that hamster wheel into a jet engine first we want to identify the unlikely Muse what do I mean by that look at industries that are thriving but vastly different from yours you know what makes them tick is it their customer service their product design their marketing tactics zero in on what it is that they do really well what are the standout practices at least once a year go to an event or trade show that is completely outside your industry and think creatively you know get outside of the the norm get outside of that bubble second is to adapt and test take the best practices the things that you learn from other Industries tailor them to your business maybe it's a subscription model from a streaming service or the personalized experience from a boutique hotel Implement those ideas and small controlled experiments and see how they fit your Market try it out because your competitors aren't doing it and third is to integrate and iterate not everything will be a perfect fit right away and some things never will be and that's okay just be ready to tweak and adjust you know gather feedback measure results and refine these borrowed strategies until they seamlessly integrate into your business model adopt them make them yours you have make them your way put your little spin on them and here is my big aha moment and that is that growth doesn't always come from looking within it comes from Having the courage to look Beyond by cross-pollinating those ideas from different Industries taking that the songs and remixing them in a different way you're not just following a trend you're creating one it's a recipe to stand out and never ever settle for average so next time you find yourself maybe feeling a little bit stuck remember the key to sustainable growth future proof might just be hiding in plain sight like across the street in a completely different industry down the hall in a completely different industry step out of your comfort zone steal a page from their playbook and watch as your business evolves into a Powerhouse of innovation our founder on Tuesday was Pascal Weinberger co-founder and CEO of bin. we talked about scaling smart micro SAS and using AI to solve big problems quickly and Pascal has built the company in a really smart way and some tips that you can use there as well our expert guest last week was Andrew Lee founder of parallaxis capital we talked about scaling up with a combination of innovative and practical insights crawl walk run strategy and attracting top talent if you missed either of those episodes go back and give them a listen good stuff there my guest today is Michael beg co-found founder of AMZ advisors an expert in e-commerce and digital marketing he's helped clients drive over half a billion in online sales the ventures include AMZ courses which educates Amazon sellers on boosting sales and go Advance aiding Brands and expanding into Latin America welcome someone dedicated to helping all of us build efficient go to market motions and succeed online Michael beg hey Mike welcome to SAS fuel hey Jeff thank you for having me here today tell me a little bit about your background and how did you get into marketing and Entrepreneurship yeah so I definitely don't have a traditional background in college I studied economics political science graduated went and worked at deoy Consulting after deoy realized I hated Consulting and wanted to go into real estate so I got some certifications in real estate from NYU went into real estate development working for Sears obviously the retailer that no longer exists and during that time I was working on real estate developments and we spun off a reat spun off $2.5 billion worth of real estate I started managing my own development projects after that at sear and it's where I started seeing the writing on the wall for sear and started seeing e-commerce starting to grow from there I jumped into e-commerce head first started selling products online originally through Retail Arbitrage so like going to Walmart going to Target buying stuff on clearance and reselling it online and that led to starting my own Brands and then from there we re figured out like we know how to do marketing on Amazon and let's start this as a service for other businesses that don't know and then from that it it just came into marketing for my business so it's been a a strange Evolution to get to to marketing I don't have a traditional background in it but growing the business to to where it is today has been a great learning experience on how to Market myself my brand my products as well as Pro the products of my clients so it's a different perspective on everything I think that's really smart and Market Arbitrage absolutely brilliant yeah a little tougher to do today than it was a few years back but a really good strategy and essentially just for the audience it's buying in one place and selling in another and just taking advantage of price differences there's some places where you can like you were saying Walmart at Target you get some a special deal on something and maybe even only in store and then you can sell it at a Marketplace somewhere else for quite a bit more and you do that at scale yeah exactly in over probably three four months we made about 10 12,000 doing that and that's what we used to fund the first brands that we started so it's pretty good money yes yes that's really good and the Sears background is pretty interesting as well yeah I've always thought if there was a company that that should have been Amazon it it was Sears because they they were doing e-commerce before e-commerce existed with a Sears catalog for decades yeah and Sears is always an interesting use case are interesting example to look at the it faced a lot of challenges the first challenge is obviously that their typical shopping audience was older so they weren't the on attuned to shopping online which is one of the challenges they poured a lot of money into Shop Your Way which turned out not working out and when I say a lot of money billions and billions of dollars and it was generating pretty much nothing and they adapted too slowly to changes in retail we had this was from when I was working there redeveloping spaces we had 100,000 square foot stores when most people were going to smaller format stores so a lot of the jobs that we were doing was like how do we split this huge store into a smaller Sears and like three other retailers to help us pay the rent or pay the operating cost or make more money from the property or increase the value whatever way we looked at it and Sears just wasn't positioned and they weren't adopting fast enough to what was coming and I think that was the biggest challenge sure yeah and we're starting to see that same kind of strategy with other retailers today just thinking about like Cole's putting Sephora stores inside of their stores and doing Amazon returns and there there's a lot of cross-pollination now between retailers where it used to just be our space and nobody gets in here exactly you have to get more creative when you look at like Sears for example when you looked at where most of the revenue was being made it was hard lines it was on the appliances so sure the appliance category was crushing everything apparel was doing terrible but when you think of a department store apparel is probably 60% of the floor space so it's like how do you actually reposition that floor space to get more sales per square foot or how do you rent it out to make more money from from another retailer so four is a good example of that it's a small format store within a store and they're paying per the square uh footage that they're using there might be there might be a sales sales Covenant in their rent as well if they hit certain certain targets they have to pay a percent of rent or percent of sales as rent so there's a lot of different interesting ways that retailers are leveraging that or can leverage that that Sears was just way too slow to adopt sure sure so what have been some key growth strategies you've seen work really well in the the digital space and marketing that that has has proven over time so when we look at overtime the the best thing that we can do in the long term is obviously SEO so when we look at how we grew our business we really focused on a few different areas it was SEO and Partnerships and then on the outbound side we focused a lot on em initially and now we've shifted more to paid ads and email so from an SEO standpoint it's one of the best long-term ways to to build a brand you can create a lot of positioning around brand Authority around Authority within a space by creating SEO content and also through Partnerships and collaborations on co-marketing that same Authority is established when another established brand is publishing content that you put together so it was really like one of the best long-term growth strategies we've had and the SEO has paid off we generate you know close to 60,000 website visitors a month which leads to a ton of leads for our company it also provides a lot of value to the people that are visiting our websites now from a partnership standpoint and this is another great use for SAS companies as well is when you are partnered with companies in the same space uh whether they're service providers or whether they're other SAS tools that don't compete with you you have the ability to produce a lot of great content together so one example of a way that we do this is through webinars uh we do two to three webinars a month with our partners in the the SAS and you related manag Services space and from that we're generating anyway anywhere from you two to 600 emails uh per webinar and that's a huge marketing source for us so not only are we getting more exposure to the other audiences of our partners but we're also getting email leads that we're able to put into our marketing funnels and sales funnels and that's a strong way to do a lot of marketing for a brand it's really smart I love collaboration and Partnerships and whether it's you retail or certainly in SAS it's one of the ways that I've grown multiple businesses is through Partnerships and I think it's one of the best ways is tapping into other people's audiences for sure and it's actually like a new strategy that I'm working on now maybe it's more common in the SAS bace but from my perspective as a a service provider I don't see this frequently but we're looking to actually partner with SAS companies that are in the e-commerce space that provide solutions that are not what we're doing as a managed service so like for us as an Amazon agency paid advertising is something we do we don't want to have a software partner that does paid advertising defeats the purpose of us but inventory forecasting Financial analytics those are all companies that don't compete with exactly what we're doing and we're trying to create a partnership where any client we bring on or anyone in our audience will get an extended free trial with these Partners so let's say it's a three-month trial if we bring on we're bringing on anywhere from 15 to 20 clients a month we're able to provide 15 to 20 new potential leads for all of our SAS partners by doing that so it's a new software marketing partnership I'm calling it but it's probably something that you've tried before in the s space yes it's a beautiful model yeah and it we're just starting to roll it out we think we're going to see some good success with it but it's one of the interesting things about Marketing in general is like when you start looking at where you and your partners are aligned or at least the partnership side partnership marketing side then you can start figuring out new ways to collaborate with them like webinars is One Way blog exchanges is another software partnership or trial Partnerships like this is another great way to do it so yeah it's always just working through new ideas I like that you you spent a lot of time educating and Advising brands on go to market what are some strategic errors that you see companies make in their marketing efforts I would say one one of the biggest strategic mistakes that most companies make and we Fallen victim to this as well it's getting overring on any one lead Channel or any one sales Channel it set you up for failure because when that lead Channel stops performing as it's going to at some point it's going to essentially leave you stranded and if you have if you're in a period of high churn if you're in a period of growth and you don't have and you're relying on this the revenue growth to keep the company keep that engine growth engine going it's when you can fall into the Trap and start falling backwards and start sliding backwards it's like all right now we need to look at fixing this as fast as possible in the short term we're going to have to lay people off or we're going to have to replace people so that's probably the biggest mistake that I've seen and in mypace it translates into getting over Reliant or the clients I work with it translates into getting over reliant on one sales platform like Amazon and not investing other ones but from a business perspective it gets it translates into being affected by specific lead channels so for example email was perfor performing phenomenally for us for years and then all of a sudden past two years email stopped performing and because of that we've had to start investing in other uh lead channels in the short term while we didn't adapt fast enough or didn't invest fast enough overring on email we experienced a period of churn and or sorry a period of slower growth I should say because of churn was happening we weren't generating enough leads from email and we weren't generating enough leads from these other channels so that's really where it can manifest from the business standpoint as well as from my business standpoint as well as how it translates to how my clients perform online that makes a lot of sense and it's so easy to rely on that you find something that works and you want to pour everything into it and so you really focus those efforts and don't get another Channel up and running at the same time and and you're right everything does fatigue at some point yes exactly and we've seen that with every channel we've seen that with paid ads we've seen that with SEO when Google makes changes to to their algorithm short-term SEO will short-term traffic will drop until we make the adjustments and start seeing pick up it happens all the time and if you don't have multiple channels going or you don't have multiple lead sources it's going to be a problem in the long term yeah so lots of challenges entrepreneurship that's just one what are some other challenges maybe you've gone through and how did you overcome them in building your business I think those are probably some of the bigger challenges is obviously like lead generation client retention is another big one the biggest thing beyond that though is probably like growth planning and Strate strategic planning on actually how to achieve your your goals if you don't have a consistent strategic plan or you're not doing strategic planning consistently throughout the course of the year as things are changing your company is not going to be able to position itself uh or identify opportunities for of weakness as you continue to grow so a good example of this would be how do we anticipate how do we anticipate the highers we're going to need need to make based on the amount of growth that we're going to have and from that we need to create a hiring Pro for to identify as we continue to grow how much capacity we have to do capacity planning or create capacity planning to see all right we have this many clients how many employees can they hit handle and then from there we can start adjusting the pro fora and there's just different layers to it and then from that's going to affect budgeting so all of these things spiral down and they're all interconnected in some way and I would say that's probably the other biggest challenge is just creating the alignment there between everything so you make sure that things don't get out of whack because if you start investing heavily in one area where it's I don't want to say not necessary but it's gonna have a negative shortterm effect on the bottom line versus investing that money into other areas that would help you grow more that's where you could struggle a little bit as a business and where things can get really out of whack and you're going to have to make go through the same period of making layoffs to make adjustments to things and that's not fun for anyone right right as you have grown had success how is your approach to leadership and team building evolved over time and as you've grown and even entered new markets I think the approach that I've taken is that communication needs to come from the top and the leadership that we have needs to be clearly communicated so comes down to a few different ways that we do that one is through planning one is through getting team members involved in the planning the other is through having consistent communication or having consistent intervals of where we're communicating things so a good example of this would be at the highest level we're having weekly strategic planning calls we're having monthly planning calls where we're updating the Strategic plan we're having monthly calls with a product team monthly calls with the management team we're having quarterly calls with the entire company so we're able to communicate things in a consistent Manner and then we have daily stand-up calls where everyone's talking about their problems on the individual teams so it creates a structure where communication is Flowing where we're identifying problems quickly and where we're able to communicate what we want as the leaders to the team I think that's a massively important thing and then communicating what the values are so like for us we focus on a few specific values and we find that a lot of our employees that come on really appreciate that and that part of that also comes down to hiring but we tell everyone we're focused on creating good communication being transparent about when you're having problems and being a problem solver trying to come to the table with a solution instead of just saying hey I have this problem I don't know what to do when you approach everything like that it makes it uh much more receptive and another thing I would add in there is being having things being uh objective instead of uh subjective so making sure that when we have a problem or we think we have a problem we have the data to back it up or to justify because then if it's if it turns into hey this person's not doing their job that's very subjective from the person complaining about it we need to see the actual numbers that are justifying that this person's not doing their job and then we could take you know action from there so creating that kind of alignment comes in a variety of different ways like I said communication having the core values that you're focused on and then recruiting the type of people that you want that that embody those values and we just made a new hire recently who came in and he talked to a number of the team he went through the interview process where we talk through this stuff and then he had his call with me the CEO and I literally pretty much said the same exact thing he had been hearing the entire time so he's like wow this is great like I've never heard this from a company that's so aligned and I think that's really important from the hiring an employee perspective is that when the leadership team has a Clear Vision of what they're trying to achieve and it's being communicated clearly throughout the organization is able to make a lot more progress together yeah that is so good how did you come up with the the values here core values is that something that you did on your own did you do it with your team it started yeah it started just on my own and then it just tou like having similar conversations with the team and seeing what they valued the most and it really just came out of just questioning stuff myself and one of the ways I did that was using like start with why like Simon cenic process uh of identifying it I think that's super important that's one way of questioning things another way of questioning things is uh frustrates me the most and what do I like uh from other people and then that kind of helped me identify more things to to focus on and really it just came down to thinking like honestly what do I think is the most important and being transparent communicating and being a problem solver I think is more trans is more important than anything if you're communicating well it's going to resolve most of the problems if you're transparent it's going to help us identify problems and if you're a problem solver we're going to get better resolutions or we're going to come up with better ideas on how to solve problems so so that as an organization is what I thought would help us grow further and then stepping back a little bit like one of the the big I say mentors but one of the big business people that I get a lot of my ideas from is Richard Branson and one of the clear clear things that he communicates through his book is taking care of your employees so we try to focus on taking care of the employees by being transparent by communicating clearly with what's going on and by trying to help them solve their problems and they appreciate that so much more they stick around much longer and they try to embody that same that same mentality when they go to talk to their clients want some fresh ideas to stand out in a noisy

growth principles to attract ideal clients convert them and then transform them into your brand ambassadors pick up the print ebook or audio today at smallfish bigpond.com or Amazon remember all book profits go to charity always I like that and when you have that as a core value it makes it really easy to say here they are and and you're hiring problem solvers you know you're looking for and it's a skill that is part of what you do and so I think that just makes it that much easier in the hiring process to decide somebody a good fit are you a problem solver and you're like figuring that out in the interview process and it's changed over time so like that wasn't the initial process we had and the initial process we had was more like hey we have these constraints on our time uh on our bandwidth let's hire someone to help us with this and those people didn't necessarily embody those same traits they were really nice people they were pretty good at communicating but they weren't really problem solvers so when they hit a roadblock the problem was just spiraling back uphill to us so it was changing the way that we hire changing what we're looking for when we hire replacing the people that are not a fit and then continuing to recruit people that are a fit so it's not a it was never a consistent way that we were doing this all the time it's what we evolved to and what we've seen work the best for the growth we're achieving but if I could do it again what I'm doing now is exactly what I would do from the start and start hiring the people that fit the value that we have that makes a lot of sense you've expanded internationally what kind of unique challenges and and strategies for expanding internationally especially in diverse markets because you've got Latin America and Asia which I mean both of those are very different in themselves but also very different from each other yeah and that's a very good point is that culturally there are very big differences between all of these markets so like I for example live in Mexico and we have an office here in Mexico this is actually where we made our original hires we've grown in Mexico to about 30 employees but now we've expanded Beyond Mexico to other countries that are in Latin America we have Columbia Brazil Argentina and Venezuela and those are similar cultural wise at least to to what we have in Mexico so that makes it easier we also find that majority of our clients are North American based or or US based Mexico and the US also has similar culture apart from like language different differ is like the way Mexicans behave at least consumer behaviors and work behaviors are very similar to the US and the expectations are very similar because of proximity when we start going further away when we look at Asia Philippines India Pakistan where we've hired a lot of other employees the cultural differences are more noticeable so the recruiting is a little bit Challen is a little bit more challenging for example a good example of this is some of the challenges we face with our Asian employees is communicating the problem communicating when things are a problem so we had an example of this recently where during the daily standup meeting no one communicated the problem because they didn't want to bring the problem up to their manager right and a week later we C it came back to us and we were like why didn't no one say this and we went to them and like oh like I didn't want to bring it up that's what we don't want so it's identifying that and then reinforcing it to get people into what we do like or into the structure we do want I would say the biggest challenges when expanding internationally usually come around pain p and payments to employees so dealing with International payments is usually costly like for example we're using a platform right now there's a variety of different things but we're using a platform right now called wise for international payments which make things pretty simple but we used three or four other platforms before that where they banned us from the platforms because we were sending so much money uh and that was a problem so it's like now you have to Pivot quickly to figure that out so once you have a solid payment system in place that's one key the other one is employer of record so for example we started a company and this goes into two different things but employer of records how are you actually going to pay these people for compliance standpoints a lot of our employees in countries where we don't have a a large Workforce so countries where we have one to two people are independent contractors other employees in countries where we have more are employees hired through a third party so adjusting on how you're going to retain your work for Force how you're going to incentivize them in the right way is important when you're looking at expanding into a country and if you don't do that it could lead to employee turn it could lead to lawsuits and other problems like I've had that happen where we've had to pay termination fees in Mexico for example for not having someone hired the correct way or not having things documented the correct way so that's frustrating so that's a big thing you can avoid and the other thing that you can't really anticipate is changes in in law in how things actually run and this happened to us originally when we came to Mexico we started an entity with a couple friends to hire essentially all the employes of all of our companies as honorarios is what they're called but essentially honorario is like a legal contractor in Mexico and that worked fine for the first two three years but then the government came in it changed and they changed the laws on us and the structure we had was no longer legal so from that we had to start pivoting and and adjusting to everything like that so anticipating legal differences or or changes in legal systems is really hard and the other big difference coming from the US is that when we're working in Latin America and even Europe to some extent apart from the the UK you're looking at common versus civil law and civil law is codified there's not much there's no interpretation it's like this is what it is and if you don't do this that's it there's no gray area it's not like oh this employee like didn't show up for work doesn't matter like you owe them this money because it legally says you owe them this money and in the US and UK common law is a lot easier and common law countries are a lot easier to deal with in general so adopting to that is another big challenge of the international expansion side are specific is there specific advice that you would give as companies are thinking about hiring offshore teams or expanding their operations internationally things that you've learned and say do this or don't do that yes I think there are the first thing I would say is from the start just try to hire through an e it's generally the easiest way to go about it a lot of startups try to take shortcuts with independent contractors using like wa Ben forms yeah those work but in general like it doesn't have the feeling of from the employee perspective doesn't have the feeling that the company is like legitimate or the company is is big enough or has the right growth structure when you set the expectation from the beginning that you're going to do everything correctly and you know buy the book it makes the employee believe in the company more so it creates more credibility for what you're doing it's not just like hey this is a an independent job or a contractor job until I find something better it's like no this is a real company that I'm G to be a part of and I'm gonna grow with the company so that's the first thing I would point out is just do things correctly from the beginning another thing that I would say say is really important is actually how frequently you touch base with them it's easy to have people that are in different time zones and it's hard to find time to connect and yes having a way to have consistent touch points with them and make them feel engaged in the company is the other key for us being in Mexico or me being in Mexico and having a lot of our employees in Latin America it's much easier we're all on similar time zones so we are able to connect a lot more and the other great thing is that if I wasn't living here if I was living in the US somewhere it's only a few- hour flight to Mexico so being a to see people in person is another big way to have those touch points we flew some of our employees up from South America up here to Mexico for an employee meeting and they were thrilled they were all they loved being here in person with everyone it makes a big difference when you actually involve people like that so I think those are the things you just need to consider is like do it right from the start make sure your employees feel engaged and make sure that you have consistent touch points with them to to make them feel that their contribution is really valued that's so important yeah a lot of people probably don't know just the tech industry in Mexico is really booming you've got to guara which is the the Silicon Valley of Mexico and how does that influence your Tech operations and Business Development so for us we're being here in guara is phenomenal we worked with a variety of different vendors we don't have anyone internally but we work with a variety of different vendors that are here in guadalahara to help us with projects that we need done so for a few different examples of this is for us has been like different reporting tools or different API connections based for reporting based on things we need internally versus client stuff from a US business perspective the cost of hiring someone here is obviously much cheaper I will say that tech people are still paid significantly more than everyone else here so don't expect it to be like don't expect to be like nothing you're going to pay a good salary a good Tech a good person a good coder a good developer whatever you want to call them you're probably looking at starting base salary between 4 to 6K a month so that's still a significantly lower salary than what you're to pay for someone in the US so that's the other big benefit and then the other thing is that especially here in Mexico not just from the tech side but for tech companies the level of English is extremely high and if you can find people or employees that are in business development or marketing or other areas that have high levels of English it's going to be much easier for you to start growing the company and start driving revenue from making hires here so a good example of this is like we have a few of our team members that grew up in Canada others that grew up in the UK others that grew up in the US so they all sound native they probably speak better English than I do at this point but when you are able to make those types of hires obviously the the the savings on the human capital side is huge it allows you to keep F uh putting more money into the actual development of your product the growth of your product and I think that's really where you start getting the flywheel going on the SAS side at least is how do I start reinvesting more dollars into the growth versus just reinvesting more dollars into high-cost Talent right right how have you adapted your marketing and business strategies to fit the the cultural diversity and and geographically dispersed markets oh that's a tough one I think business strategy wise it we're all at the end of the day like we're mainly focused on the majority of our clients which are in the US so it's more just getting the existing teams aligned to what the clients in the US want a lot of that goes happens through processes like uh client attention uh client surveys client feedback like I I personally have quarterly calls with all the clients so we're generating a lot of the feedback there so having good process feedback or having a good feedback process I should say is a great way uh to start getting your team aligned because the team starts hearing what the clients want based on the location and then they start adapting the way that they produce the work or the way that we're producing the product to to meet their expectations I think that's a really big one there another way that we can use the international Workforce to get strategies aligned is by yeah I guess I'll say it this way by identifying opportunities in some of these marketplaces that our us clients can take advantage of so for a good example of this is we have another company here in Mexico that does product distribution so this was an opportunity that came across because we realized our employees in Mexico don't have access to the same product selection that we have in the US so like if I go to Amazon I can buy whatever if I come to Amazon in Mexico the product selection I have is much more limited and the reason that we identified this opportunity was listening to the feedback that our employees in these Target markets have so for example I I met another company like this recently they were coming down to Mexico to do product research I think it was a German company to do market research to launch their product in Mexico and whatever the product was I'm not exactly sure but they're seeing opportunities by going somewhere finding if there's demand for it and then launching there and it's the same type of idea if you have employees in Mexico Brazil Argentina wherever there's probably demand in those countries for things that your company's already producing or things that are similar to what your company's doing and it's an easy Revenue grab because you have people that are in those markets you can hire in those markets easily and you can start growing within those markets and help the overall growth of the company so I think those are probably the two big things the the feedback process and then identifying opportunities in the international markets I didn't realized that the the marketplaces in in other countries were that much different but they really are and it was had a friend come from Brazil to the US and doing all these Amazon orders here and taking stuff back like why don't you just do that there and he explained it to I like I had no idea that it was really that much different yeah there's a big difference there's a huge difference in between countries and even between when we do a lot of work here in Latin America so even between Mexico Brazil Mexico Argentina the differences are massive and again going back to what we talked about before between regulatory differences and fiscal differences taxes are incredibly different different between markets so like for with physical Goods this is a big problem it's a little bit different with tech but importing products to Brazil any product over $50 has like a 96% tax on it it's insane importing products from Mexico to the US or I should say us to Mexico has a 16% tax so you're looking at a huge difference there between between the two countries 70% difference between the two or 80% difference between the two it's wild so yeah there's a lot of inefficiencies that exist Within These markets that foreigners don't really see unless they're either have employees dealing with these challenges and that have exposure to how things work in other countries or if they're there themselves and see what these inefficiencies are because all of these inefficiencies what they do is just create new opportunities for businesses and it's really just down to the right entrepreneur to figure out how to take advantage of it yeah yeah and how are you using your customer feedback how do you keep that Loop going where you're taking their feedback and implementing and continuing to get that so the way that we do it is we get the feedback from a variety of different ways the feedback is reviewed by the customer success team from there we try to identify whether it's an expectation issue or whether it's a product issue whatever the cause may be and from there whatever the solution is it ends up on a strategic plan and then on the Strategic plan the team members responsible for addressing that are the ones that are implementing it and making changes so that's what the process itself looks like a good example of this would be a strategic report that we're producing for our clients now the client feedback that we were getting from multiple clients was that they don't have enough insight into what the strategy is that came back to our customer success team the customer success team came up with different ideas on how to improve the strategy we provide a report we have video calls we do this what that led to on the Strategic plan was creating the strategist role producing strategy reports aligning the client creating C customer satisfaction surveys after they received the strategy so all of those things came from hearing that feedback and it allowed us to improve and what happens is once the clients have more insight into the feedback they're much happier the expectations are met we're able to get the direct feedback from these surveys and figure out if this is the strategy they're looking for or not so that's kind of an easy example of how we use that feedback system to directly lead to changes within the company and we also do the same type of idea within the company so we have surveys with each employee it's Anonymous so we don't know who they are but they can give us feedback on everything in the company that they think is working well things that are not working well and all of that helps us improve in the same way and what we learn out of that ends up on the Strategic plan so it's going out there getting the feedback figuring out a way to make it figuring out ideas on how we can make it uh implementable and then figuring out how we actually implement it so important to to not just gather the data but to actually take action on that and was a really good process FL out ah thank you yeah so what what emerging marketing Trends do you think will be crucial for entrepreneurs to understand and leverage over the next few years so it obviously the big Trend we've seen over the past few years I think it's going to continue has been video or the rise of video Tik tok's obviously just become massive over the past few years video shopping is already massive in like Asian markets starting to become more more important in the US that in a variety of different ways from video ads on Amazon shopping like Tik Tok shops Instagram uh stores like all these different ways to buy directly from video is one Trend uh so being able to produce content for the platforms that are popular is gonna be one of the biggest challenges like we personally don't do a great job in producing video content it's a huge thing that we need to solve so that is one Trend that we're trying to tackle another big trend is just the rising cost of marketing and trying to find ways to be more efficient so for example the cost of advertising in in Amazon has just increased every year there's more more sellers coming on there's more money being poured into advertising so we're looking at other ways on how to be more cost effici or how to blend our average customer acquisition cost down we're looking at Alternatives like affiliate marketing influencer marketing is similar so looking at other marketing channels that you're currently not using to bring down your overall advertising cost is going to be important for brands in the D well in the online space of digital space continue to grow because if you going back to what we talked about earlier if you continue to rely on a single lead Channel and the cost of a lead channel is just going to continue to increase over time your profit margin is going to be continued to be eaten away so figuring out new ways to attract uh leads to attract clients in a lower cost is going to be more important and that's just tapping into new channels uh trying things you haven't tried before and seeing what performs and what doesn't I Like It where can people learn more about you online and and
