afternoon or evening wherever you are. Um, thanks for joining us today. Um, we're gonna just wait a few minutes for others to to join the webinar, but Sophie, good to see you. Um, hey, so I didn't ask you, are you are are you in London? Are you based there? >> Based in the British countryside. >> Oh, okay.

Cool. I was born in Wembley. >> Oh, nice. That's literally a hob. >> Yeah, right by the stadium.

Yeah. So I used to hear all the football matches you know at night. It was it was it was fun as a kid. So >> a lot of big moments have happened at Wembley. >> Yeah.

So but by seven I was in the US. So it was uh it was early years you know but but memorable. So have you been there long uh in in London? >> About 10 years now. Oh >> okay. >> Back from the US.

We were in the US for 10 years with my husband >> and then we went through Paris because I'm French. Um we tried Paris and then hopped over to London. >> Yeah. Where where were you in the US? >> Uh so I started in New York then moved to California. It was my NBA there and then moved to Seattle with my husband.

>> What part of California? North or South? >> Uh Palo Alto. Oh, okay. Great. Yeah, just I'll be there today later today for a meeting. But yeah, >> nice.

It's a great part of the world. A lot of things happening. >> Yeah, there's a lot happening out here. So, but I'm back and forth to LA. I was at LA Tech Week two weeks ago.

So, I was down there. Um, very different. you know, I would say a lot more consumer tech, climate tech, um, obviously Hollywood and content creation related things. um you know and you just you you uh you build products in uh the Bay and you test them in LA where you've got so many different cultures and and people and audiences, you know, and it's easy to kind of go see what's going to happen and you come back to the lab up north to keep iterating and building, you know, as kind of the play. >> Yeah.

>> Um okay, cool. Let's do this. Let's see. I think we we've got enough of a contingency and we'll just get started. Sophie, um so again, Sophie, thank you so much for joining.

Um welcome. Um you know, I really uh read your background and you've got a great experience in lots of different industries in fintech, consumer, uh marketplaces. Um so really appreciate you joining us today. Um so let's kick off with >> Yeah, sorry. Um let let's kick off with this which is um you know we have a lot in common the two companies right so think and grow is involved in a lot of expansion and and new market development for for SAS companies globally for a decade um localize uh fits into that box helping them uh accelerate uh their localization efforts and that's really something I've seen uh change um you know with the use of AI and so now you're able to expand and land in a new market and and really um accelerate the growth and opportunity there.

So tell me more about that what you're seeing and how has AI really helped uh change the landscape. >> Uh so it's it's changed the landscape quite drastically in um in localization. If you think of localization a few years ago, it was mostly workflow management, approval and distribution really of the work that had to be done to uh various trans to to translators. Uh and then back in and approval. Uh now with the platforms like localiz you have a real you can automate a lot of that process and so you have very high level of automation.

you you have AI powered translation and it's actually a lot harder to do AI powered translation than people think. guess not just let me put it in chat GPT and and retrieve there's a lot of AI orchestration to make sure that you have the right um context and the right quality but really today if you are uh and in Europe actually companies go international and multil- language sooner because their market is smaller in the US we see that it typically is a bit later in their development but in in Europe you see these companies go very from the very early stages going international, it's a lot easier to do now. It's a lot cheaper. You can do it a lot faster. Um, you can launch with localiz, you can launch a new product feature in 13 languages in 5 hours.

>> Uh, and so that that continuous localization flow and automation and AI localization is now something that is it's a reality for customers. And then customers choose where do I really want to have human oversight uh human creativity human approval make sure that what I localize has been done in the best possible way but it it has become super uh very easy to do and very automated. >> Sure. That's amazing. Yeah.

So I mean scaling a business globally I mean five hours versus I don't know if it would even be five months. it would take longer to do what you just said for a product in 13 different languages you know um [clears throat] and you you know you personally have scaled a lot of businesses right so um we you know fintech travel u B2B software SAS companies um let's talk about that in terms of you know as you move from industry to industry not just companies in a same sector but industry to industry what are some of the things that that you took as part of your next stage growth or scaleup playbook that traveled well across uh those different industries. Um but it it actually travels well across different um there's a lot of that is applicable across all of those um B2B B2C marketplaces, fintech um because when you the way I the way I think of scaling is that I don't think scaling is the sexy bit. Um people think scaling is sexy. Scaling is a lot about fixing problems, finding solutions, finding your next level of growth and um it actually helps to have B2C, B2B different domains because it gives you a lot broader playbook uh and experience for how you're going to solve those problems.

Um if you're you're lucky when you scale you have you start with a very good >> product market fit and you have to and it's small and you just have to make it bigger but that's very very rare usually uh by the time you scale there's more competition your customer needs have evolved and it's all about the problem solving so having a range of I have found that having a range of industry different industry experiences helps you find more creative um find more creative solutions really and then for the specifics of the industry you bring in experts. So in fintech you have to understand compliance. In rail travel you have to understand government local government regulation. In marketplaces you have to understand supply and demand uh balance and inventory management. It's you bring experts learn.

>> Yeah. Well, when you look at that first 90 days for you um as you enter a new business, right, and and maybe even tell us about what at localized what happened or one of your stories of the the great companies you've built, but when you when you step into a business that first 90 days, what's kind of your uh uh 90-day not [snorts] the the whole plan, but like the first diagnosis that you make to either unblog or find those paths where you and uh you can see oh here's ways we can accelerate growth or unblock growth whatever the case might be you know >> so the first 90 day I think everyone in their first 90day does this you you listen a lot so you listen to your customers you listen to your team your prospects your competitors you learn um I the when I look back because I've on boarded quite a few times when I look back I always feel uh it I was too tempted to go into quick wins and those wins they drag you down the detail like stay for as long as you can. You have those two months to learn. Don't go down too quickly. Get that full picture.

Uh you will regret it later on. So take that time to really listen. And like one of the uh one of the things I've learned is when you're when I'm on boarding in that first 90 day, the thing you have to choose really quickly is am I doing a strategy on boarding or am I doing an ops on boarding >> if there's something if you need to fix the strategy uh because the job to be done has changed or the business model has changed like what when you join that business what has to be really joined If it's strategic you because of competition because of how that world has evolved it's a very different on boarding than if it's an ops on boarding. >> Uh at localize actually the strategy was quite straightforward. The founders had started it in a direction that made a lot of sense.

Um and so my onboarding was a lot more all right like that that direction is fine what I need to on board on is not the strategy and the job to be done and the business model it's a lot more how do we get the execution right uh and how do we and and I think you have to decide that very quickly and we actually at at um know they say you know in the first 90 days you need to look at the strategy and then you need to decide the execution ution. It was very it was quite quickly clear to me that we didn't have a it was not the strategy. It was on boarding. Therefore, we even said to the team, we're not even looking at the strategy. We'll deal with the strategy in eight, nine months.

We'll do a deep dive. The strategy is fine. It's all about execution, getting the right teams in place, getting the right execution, getting the right rhythm >> in the business. I think that's very important. 90 days.

>> Sure. And I and I feel like um you know when you're when you're doing that and it's an operational uh um kind of execution that you're after uh it's it's it's a lot of blocking and tackling, you know, like there's just a lot of things to do and you got to do it the right time frame and the pieces and the people and changing processes, you know. So, it's a it's a lot of work like that. Not that strategic changes aren't uh either, but it's just different because there's uh and I want to hear from you, not me, but I would like to hear your thoughts about when when you've had those moments where it hasn't been an operational change, but it's more about strategy and like getting the right strategy and figuring out whether it's product fit or the way to enter the market or how to win over competition. Like tell me about one of those.

um because they're very interesting and it's it's it's a lot of work but it's less like um you know t uh t tactical you know >> yeah um so one of those in fintech remittance so I joined it was world remit world was built on the premise that it was one of the first companies to do a true digital value proposition for remants. So this is this is migrants who left their home, live in a different country and then send money back to typically Philippines, Nigeria, Kenya, Mexico. So you have big they're called corridors but you have big corridors of money movements like that. Um >> and so when I and when I joined the business, it was like they had built a fantastic platform and and business but competition was different. Like you have those moments where you have a disruption and part of that disruption was um the business was built the business built its own tech stack for fintech remittance because it didn't exist and then over the years you have this fintech as a service almost started to be built up where you can outsource you can you can buy solutions for compliance and you can buy solutions for ID verification and so it suddenly changes who is competing with you because they can leapfrog all the work that you have done.

They can just buy that tech stack as a part of that tech stack as a service. It changes how you're going to make money. It changes your business model. And so it's like it's those moments where you say, "All right, we have all that great customer base and we have a brand and we have a value proposition, but the next years are very different." And so you have to have the courage to say >> all right forget about what we've done and what we've built and what we have pride in in five years what will really matter. >> Yeah.

>> What be my modes and what do I break because it doesn't matter now that I I might have had the best back then it doesn't matter anymore because my competitor can just leap from me. And so it's it's those moments where you you just think what what am I going to rebuild? >> Yeah. No, that's a good point. I mean, I think in general with businesses, you really have to uh have a constant mindset to make sure that you are uh trying to futureproof the business, right? And skating to the pug, right? So you're you're you're you're thinking about what's going to happen over there in 3 years. Um so that's a that's a good good story on on the fintech side.

So, um, switching gears a little bit to I'd love to hear from you, um, a story about where your growth plan and and your entry into a business and some of the pieces of what you were planning and doing um, didn't work out, you know, and um, so love to hear that. >> I wish I didn't have a long list of examples for that. [laughter] >> We're going an hour. We're gonna go an hour for you. Yeah.

>> Um actually >> take localiz. So um localiz localize was really built on the premise that localization is needs to become very intuitive, very simple so that anyone in the business can drag and drop and and make it um easy and uh and it was it was therefore very natural to have a solution that was very productled. So when the founders started the business and it was 100% productled to start with grew really fast by the time I joined uh we had both a productled motion and a salesled motion. We were looking at what do we need to fix and uh I made the wrong decision. Um I thought if we I thought fixing or getting yeah getting more investment behind our productled growth would be the easiest way to get oxygen into the business while we were fixing everything else.

Um and actually didn't pan out. I think partly because the product the the customer journey had been worked on quite a few year many times and so it it was uh not optimal but it was already in good shape. Uh what we needed to change to make it even better was a real step change that required other changes in the organization uh that were that would take time and so we we tried to get more oxygen from productled like growth and that didn't work. Uh, and I wish I had spent more time upfront already doing the salesled uh salesled motion. Hey, so speaking of PLG versus uh uh sales leg growth, like h how do you just for you've done this at multiple companies, like how do you um end up seeing um the the time management and the the resource allocation across those two things for businesses and how is that different at different stages for a business? Right.

So just like to hear your thoughts on that and you know >> ideally your entire business is [sighs] no touch >> wouldn't that >> so the way we look at it is look we want to make sure that customers can do as much on their own as possible because if if they can do that it means it's intuitive and it's easy and they can they can serve locally. ization is actually not that easy. uh it comes uh when you think of uh uh the the the tech stack and the marketeteer experience localization is usually an afterthought right you you have your CMS you have your code you have your product and then you think I need to make this go into different languages and so it has to it's it's complex because it has to fit whatever process and whatever tech the um our customers have And this is why the the way for us to differentiate between those two is um there are customers who can onboard on their own and it's self-s serve and there are customers who have a uh reality we're actually being um getting more support uh from our teams for onboarding is important to their journey over time. I would love for these to be able to know for customers to be able to do everything on their own. uh we're not there yet.

And so the way I we really differentiate is uh we can support you um for those customers who have more complex journeys. >> Yeah. So you have you know you just have tiers and service and support for some and enterprise customer etc. Um so we're running on time here. Let's do this.

I just want to see if there's any questions uh uh here for us. Let's um just checking. Yeah, if anyone uh wants to ask any questions of Sophie, please just pop them into the chat. We'll we'll uh get them kind of handled for you. Sophie, maybe we have no questions.

Your communication's been so great. They have nothing to ask maybe. But >> I >> Yeah, but this has been great, you know. Um, we'll give it a second to see if anybody um um says anything. We did get a comment.

It's been fire. So, there's that. So, um but but yeah, I really appreciate your time today. Um I'll just check one more time to see if we have any questions. Nope.

Um but yeah, thank you so much for joining. Um really appreciate it. Look forward to catching up with you postinar or some other stuff. And uh thank you once again, Sophie. >> Pleasure.

Thank you very much. Thanks, Raj. It's a great series. >> We have a question. I think we should ask it.

What [clears throat] is a funny Oh, yeah. That's a good one. That's That's interesting. Um, what's a funny localization fail you've heard from companies where they tried to localize and maybe they had some language kind of mixups and said this or that, you know? >> There are quite a few um in the industry. Um, they're actually different types.

There are some there's some localization. Localization needs context. Um and so if you're localization localizing your app, for example, we have a um luckily that was with a competitor, not with us, but instead of uh translating back, you know how you go backwards in your app, um that back button in German, there are two words for back. There's back for backwards and there's back for u behind your shoulders. Um, and so when it's when it says behind your shoulders uh equivalent for a back, that's uh that's not quite intuitive for customers.

Um, but you also have a lot of translation got gone wrong like embarrassing. Um when medical devices who get translated uh sexually transmittable diseases or uh translation which are taken out of context and uh becomes more slang uh or just embarrassing. >> Yeah. Um yeah, >> there's >> there's one example I think of there was a collection of World War II era infantry figurines like these small figurines uh translated as Russian so uh toddlers. So you know when you're in a market place and you're selling figurine it's different from selling Russian toddlers all these small things that you have to catch uh and it needs a lot of context.

>> That's funny. All right. Well, thank you again. I appreciate it. Have a good evening there in London.

Thanks to everyone who joined us today and um we will catch you next time on Scaling SAS.
