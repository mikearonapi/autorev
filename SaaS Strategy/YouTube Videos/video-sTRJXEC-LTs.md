[Music] AI is something you build towards. In this fireside chat, Kevin Tolman, CEO of Megavo, shares why laying the right foundation is the key of making AI actually work uh inside real businesses. Uh drawing on experiences like healthcare practices and call data. We'll break down how small strategic steps lead to faster workflows, better service, and real business impact. why industry specific AI beats generic tools and how to know when a market is ready.

And finally, the most common mistakes companies make when verticalizing AI and how to avoid them. Whether you're just starting your AI journey or refining an existing strategy, this session will give you a practical blueprint for building AI solutions that last. How you doing today, Kevin? Good, Michael. It's always good to see you and uh grateful to be here and and talk about uh really an important topic that we're all kind of grappling with right now. Yeah, definitely.

It's uh I think it's on the minds of everybody right now and and trying to figure out how to to move forward in this AI space is is definitely key. So I guess we'll begin with you know how uh everyone's talking about AI but real adoption is messy. Uh when you started building Mango AI what everyday problem are you trying to actually solve for people? Yeah, you know, I think at Mango we we have a a little bit different approach. I don't think we can hear you, Kevin. We'll do a we'll do a subtle cut.

Yeah, I think we got you now. Nope. Can't hear you. Okay, now he's muted. Now you're muted in StreamYard.

Streamyard. It says that his mic isn't connected. Can you hear me? Yep. Okay. All right.

Do we need to start over? Sorry. We can start over. I mean, I'm sure that the beginning will be better if we start over, too. So, okay. Listen, third time's the charm, Michael.

Let's go. And it they they say that for a reason, you know. Listen, it feels right. It feels good. Let's make it happen.

Cool. AI is something you build towards. In this fireside chat, Kevin Tolman, CEO of Mango Voice, shares why laying the right foundation is the key to making AI actually work inside real business. Drawing on examples like healthcare practices and call data, we'll break down how small strategic steps lead to faster workflows, better service, and real business impact. Why industry specific AI beats generic tools and how to know when a market is ready.

And the most common mistakes companies make when verticalizing AI and how to avoid them. Whether you're just starting your AI journey or refining an existing strategy, this session will give you practical blueprints for AI solutions that last. How are you doing today, Kevin? Good, Michael. How are you? It's always uh it's always good to see you and excited to talk to you about this really important topic. Yeah, good to see you, too.

I think it's uh I think it'll be really insightful for everyone here who's who's sort of both experienced in AI and and trying to get their foot in the door. So, um while everyone's talking about AI, uh real adoption is still really messy. when you started building Mango AI, what everyday problem were you actually trying to solve first? Yeah, you know, I think for us at Mango, because we have a very vertical focused kind of go to market strategy, it what it does is it really helps us understand the nuances to the market. So our core market uh right now is dentists and you know we we currently service you know over 10,000 dental offices and so we really understand at a very deep level what some of the constraints within that market are and by understanding our core customer we're able to really build features that help with workflow automation. So the idea is what are some tasks that are currently taking place in the practice today that we can automate away with AI functionality and that's really how we've started our journey and instead of taking kind of a a really wide swath and saying hey I AI is going to solve all your problems let's look at what's one specific task that you're doing that is very manual and pro in in nature and is it within kind of our sphere that we operate and let's build through some AI tooling.

Let's build workforce automation here and automate some of these manual tasks with AI. And so that's really been how we've started to think about AI. I would say in very kind of small incremental steps, but identifying those points within the practice that we know we can address and build AI tools for that is going to help the office be much more efficient. Got it. Yeah, that makes total sense.

I guess you've built and scaled companies in multiple industries like what lessons from those experiences are shaping how you're approaching that AI uh sort of step today? Yeah, I think the first step, you know, regardless of AR or not, Michael, is scale is very difficult and to be able to get scale right is incredibly incredibly hard and you just got to be very thoughtful on how you do it. And the reason I say that is I've seen companies scale so fast that they supernova. You supernova, what happens is you forget about the customer experience because you're so hyperfocused on growth that you lose you lose sight of the most important piece which is that core customer that you're building software for. Yeah. And so, you know, I think the big lesson I've learned is if you stay just vigilant and hyperfocused on that customer and their experience, you're going to have a lot better chance of scaling whatever it is you're doing in a much better manner.

It's not saying it's not messy, but that's really been our focus, especially at Mango, is you know, just staying really vigilant to that experience. And then like I said, you know, what are some some AI tools that we can provide that help that office become more efficient, right? So I think that's the thing, Michael, is like stay focused on the things that matter. Yeah, that makes total sense, Kevin. I guess. So why do you think then building AI for like a specific um industry is maybe more beneficial than than doing a general tool? Like we see a lot of general tools out there like hey this this email service will do everything you possibly want all over like why do you think you know targeting a specific industry and and solving those needs is so impactful? I think one of the things that I personally believe in is I want to be involved in things that have maybe less breath and more depth.

And the reason why is because once you get entrenched in these markets, you just really understand like I said the nuances to the market. And specifically when we start talking about AI and how do we build impactful AI tools, one of the biggest things you need is good quality data. And the more kind of vertical in my opinion, the more verticalized you are, the better data set that you have. So, for example, if you come to dental, Mango has one of the best data sets in all of dental. Yeah.

Um, you know, well over a billion calls in our database. These are calls that we're interacting with patients, we're interacting with with payers, all these, you know, kind of nuance conversations that we have. And you think about the richness of that data set and what it allows us to understand from those interactions and then how impactful that becomes as we look to build the AI tools. Yeah. Yeah.

I guess so when do you when do you know that you're ready to build a verticalized AI within your industry? like uh what did you see with the call data you had in dentistry and healthcare practices that you're like okay we can we can take that first step well I think the first thing you know as a leader of a business you have to be thinking about every day is how are we going to incorporate AI into our platform that has to be kind of your overarching thesis right now and I'm not saying at least for us and and kind of our thesis is you know maybe AI right now is not going to solve all our problems s but there's certainly problems to be solved and our first thought should be is there AI tool that we can build that will address this so that's number one I think number two is as we've been able to you know look at our data and really start to shape it and understand it it's becoming clear that there is certain aspects within the business that we know we can address but what's been cool is that data has been telling us the story. I think sometimes, you know, we're so anxious to get something out there that we forget about the allimportant component, which is product market fit. 100%. And making sure that we really know we have product market fit. Um, I see this all the time, which is people are so anxious to get to market that they're trying to impose what they think the market needs versus listening to the market.

And so from our relationships and you know our position in the space and our data starting to marry those two things together we're getting a very clear picture of one what the market wants and then what that's going to look like within the Mango platform. Got it. Yeah. I So definitely got to listen to the market. Got to understand what is actually what it's actually calling for in in terms of AI.

or do you think AI is still falling short when it comes to helping businesses build these, you know, relationships with their customers and helping automation and and you know, fulfilling market needs? You know, the thing I'm seeing a lot is there's there is a lot of hype around AI and you know, I think there's some some I think certainly interesting aspects to it. I think in a lot of cases it still falls short and when you look at just the sheer capital investment into AI and then look at the the return on those investments we haven't seen them yet. That doesn't mean that they're not going to materialize, but we really haven't seen that to a large degree. And so that's why I think we've been much more surgical and saying let's let's find those key pieces and invest in that, right? And so it's I I think for us it's much more of kind of a methodical nuanced approach versus like scorched earth approach. Yeah.

Yeah. 100%. Do you have an example of like when really diving in and and and sort of going deep with one verticalized AI tool is has really outperformed more of a general broader tool. Yeah. I think, you know, an example here at Mango is, you know, late Q4 last year, we launched what we called Mango AI, which was starting to do, you know, some interesting things around phone calls and opening up data sets to offices.

And there was a few kind of key pieces within Mango AI that really addressed what I talked about, which is taking away manual tasks and using AI to automate those and actually create greater transparency for the office. And you know, since we launched that really it's it's one or two features within there that have just really been impactful for practices. And now we have thousands of practices that have adopted that technology for one simple reason. It's made their life easier. Yeah.

And I think that's where AI is really impactful when you find those, you know, little kind of it's almost treasures where it's like, oh man, we can address that. We can do it. We can do it really well with the technology that's available today. Yeah. I think there's still some bleeding edge technology.

Um I know you guys are working on it. Um you know we've been uh you know kind of strategizing together on this front as voice agents for example. Um and anybody that's been part of a real time system which is voice agents. Yeah. Realize just is the massive complexity of trying to do that and then trying to go anywhere.

Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And doing that at any type of scale. Um, so I think there's still some things that, you know, the technology isn't quite there, but I think it's rapidly approaching that, which is super exciting.

And, you know, that goes back to really how we feel like we're positioned with our data set that we are positioned really well as as those technologies continue to emerge to be able to to build solutions for for uh the market. Yeah, that makes total sense. and and kind of we we went towards the tool side and and you you mentioned it that the the data set or or the the call data we've been talking about is really the basis of that like without like those are sort of the raw materials for the tools that we're making. Um can you kind of go into to what having a strong foundation in that data set in that call data like takes and why that's so important when you're building these out? So, one thing you know as you're building voice agents, one of the hard one of the hardest parts of this is that these don't hallucinate, right? That you you essentially don't leave them to their own devices. And, you know, I think about this in my life.

I've got a a nine-year-old son and a seven-year-old son. And if I was to leave them at home by themselves, I don't know what's going to happen. We we may come home these like, who knows what's going to happen, right? But if we put some controls around them, right, like one of their older sisters stays home with them, there's a high degree of confidence that everything's going to be just fine. And I think good data around these models is really kind of that moat that starts to say, hey, we get really confident with how these are going to respond. And the way we're thinking about this at Mango is let's take a practice for example.

We can go download the last five years of every call that they ever made and we can then develop and say, "Hey, what's the 50 most asked questions that this practice gets." Yeah. So going in to build, you know, that model for that practice, we already know the 50 questions that they're going to get asked. And now you start talking about what's the prompting we want for those, right? And that's really, as you know, the secret sauce. And so instead of trying to throw a generalized model at an office, we're throwing a very specific, you know, kind of prompted model at that office knowing that these are the questions they're going to be asked and how we want to respond to those. Yeah, that make Yeah.

And and I think I think that's I think you hit the nail on the head like you know the the better material you'll give it the better material comes out of it. You know like it's it's really about setting that the uh setting it up to succeed and then allowing like you know using the prompt to enhance the data not necessarily fix the data. Um 100%. Uh I guess so I mean as you verticalized I imagine that you've had some trial and error with uh figuring out how to to really go deeper with your AI. Uh what are some mistakes that you have experienced or you're seeing others experience in terms of verticalizing AI? I think one of the things that you know initially we really struggled with and and I can admit it which is almost kind of this FOMO mentality which is well if we're not doing something we're losing and not being really kind of thoughtful and strategic about how we want to approach that and I think you kind of alluded to it which is taking kind of this broad brush and saying we're just going to build something that everybody in the market's going to want.

And as we did that, we just realized if we're not really careful right now, um, we're going to fall on our face and this is not going to materialize, right? In in in the sense of adoption from the market. And that's when we really kind of stepped back, Michael, and we said, "Okay, let's break down every aspect of the office and let's let's just hone in on very specific tasks within that office and that's what we're going to address." and then we'll move to the next one and the next one. So instead of this kind of broad approach, it was one task at a time and then we have to think about too within within those tasks, is this an area that Mango touches and is it something we should solve or should it be something that we collaborate with a partner on? And so that's part of this conversation too, Michael, which is going to our partners, our, you know, integration partners for example, and saying, "Hey, we see this task in the office as something that AI can address, but we need to do it with you." Yeah. And that's been, I think, really exciting from our perspective is having those conversations with our partners and getting them to see what we can do together. Yeah.

versus what we can do individually, which is which is really exciting for us. And I imagine that those partner conversations are super impactful to how you guys move forward with your AI development and deployment. Um I guess one question, different kind of conversation here is like how do you really take customer feedback into um how you're deploying and utilizing AI? Like I'm sure everybody has an idea of how it can solve that one problem that they have. like how do you take in the good and and sort of orchestrate and understand how to to navigate the bad? Yeah, I think this is, you know, for us something that we work really hard on, which is, you know, being really close to our customers. We want to hear the the good, the bad, and the ugly.

And so we do it in a couple ways. One is we can do it through our support channel. Um, you know, we filled close to 11,000 calls every month from from customers. And I still think, you know, I think some people kind of think it's a crazy, but having those those touch points human to human are still really valuable because we get a lot of great insights from those customers, whether it's good or bad, right? So, we're we're we're bringing that data point is from actual interactions with customers. two is um being very ingrained, right? Whether it's through our partners or like I said through through our support channels, we're able to to get a lot of data from our partners as well on what they're hearing from their customers.

Yeah. Um and put that perspective, you know, with our partners, Michael, I mean, we're talking well over a 100,000 offices in the market that they're getting feedback to that's coming back to us. So that's been really good value. And then the other thing we've done is we've done some surveys and just asked offices, you know, specific questions about AI, but even overarching like, do you even have plans to implement AI in your practice? And, you know, a large cohort still says no. And I think because no one has been able to clearly communicate to them what the value prop of that is and what it's going to do.

Yeah, that makes that makes total sense. I I think communication really is key there. Making sure that everyone's on the same page and and moving forward together. Um yeah, I I think that's spot on, Kevin. Um I guess looking at the future, I mean, we there's still such a collection of people out in the world.

Uh I think you used cohort and that's a great word for it. Um there's still so much untapped potential there. What do you see verticalized AI specifically going like the next five years? Yeah, I think there's going to be some really um incredible opportunities for companies and I think this goes back to you know really the innovative dilemma which is what are you going to do as a company and I think if you're not deeply contemplating how AI will disrupt you you're not thinking about the right thing 100% and you know interesting enough I was you know meeting with my my partner a couple weeks ago and he always asks me this question at least once a month. Um, what keeps you up at night, Kevin? And I said, "There's one thing that keeps me up at night and it's AI." Yeah. And you know, it's just allowed me, I think, to really think about how AI could actually disrupt Mango.

And thinking about if I was going to disrupt Mango, what would I do? And that's been part of our kind of core strategy around this is thinking a lot around, you know, that aspect of the business. Um, and I think it's helped us really think differently. Um, we obviously want to focus on our core customer and continue to drive value for them, but we're also thinking about what's that innovator's dilemma and what's the disruption that is potentially around the corner because this technology I think I'll say I think because I I don't know definitively, Michael. I think it potentially is massively disruptive. I mean, if I was a betting man, I' I'd agree with you.

I think there's no way you can look at what's happening right now and and not see the change that's just eminent. Um what's what's something that you think everyone should really do this next quarter as we sort of end out uh Q2? I guess we're right in the middle of Q2 and going into Q3. What if you had to challenge everyone to take one step forward in AI? What would what would you recommend? I think the the first thing is you know one of the things you can do is look internally too and say what are some what's some tooling we can use internally because I think we want to use internal tools that use AI because we want to know what that experience is like as well. Yeah. I think what that does is that gives you a frame of reference of what will my customers experience.

Does that make sense? Yeah. 100%. It's it's not the same thing, but it starts to get you and your team one to know what that experience is like, and two, I think it gets them thinking about what's possible within our platform. Yeah, we've been able to do this with like our support team, for example, and we've built some really cool internal tooling that has made our support team massively more efficient. And a lot of this is because we started to expose them and say, "Hey, play with this." Yeah.

Um, and so now what we're doing is we're saying before you ask for a new tool, you have to think will AI solve this problem first. That is the first thing. And if you haven't thought about that, don't even don't even bring it up. Yeah. Yeah.

100%. I think that's a great insight is is really self- adoption and and implementation into your own workflow will will empower you to to enable it within your customers workflows. Um, really walking a mile in their shoes. Um, I guess what going back to when you first started sort of this this AI journey, what's one thing that you wish you knew that if you can go back in time you'd tell yourself? I think you know one of the challenges I have personally um as a CEO is I'm I'm not an engineer. I'm not overly technical.

Yeah. And you know, I always tell our dev team, the trust that I have to have with you is incredibly important because I can I can do any job at Mango except for what they do. Yeah. And I think if I had to go back, it would probably be really starting to have deep conversations with our engineering team and saying, "What are the tools that you guys need to better understand this technology and probably starting those conversations a little bit earlier and getting them thinking more and more about how do we do this?" I'm I'm confident we're there right now, Michael. Yeah.

You know, you could always argue and said, should we be where we're at today, a year ago? Sure. Yeah. There could have been less pain there potentially, right? Or we're a little bit farther ahead. Um, it is what it is. Like, can't live your life in their rear view.

It's not worth it. Um, yeah. But I think that's probably one thing we potentially should have done earlier. Awesome. Yeah.

I mean, that's great insight. I think um I think as we move forward it's it's always important to to learn from where we came from, right? And so so sort of understanding, you know, what what you would have done different and making sure to actually apply it to how you move forward is really really impactful and valuable there. So yeah, and I would say the other thing that has been really impactful for me personally, right, is is I mean you work for him, Dave. um you know spending a lot of time with Dave and having you know pretty deep philosophical conversations about this um you know I think Dave has a pretty unique kind of viewpoint on this. Yeah.

And um in a lot of ways not in a lot of ways in some ways I think he's converted me in some aspects. Um but that that's been you know really helpful for me. Um, and you know, we still talk almost every day and a lot of it is around AI and you know, what we're learning. Yeah. I mean, I I feel like I learn something new every day with it.

You know, you you feel like you got a grasp and then either a new new tool comes out or a new article comes out and all of a sudden it opens a new door. So, I think continuing to push forward and and learn and grow is is uh and and find those mentors, find the people that you can, you know, work with and talk to, I think is super valuable. Um, awesome. Well, I think that that sort of wraps up what our conversation, Kevin, I really appreciated you being here and and uh you know, taking the time. Um, any final thoughts you wanted to add before we we sort of head out and and allow the the fine people at the TalkAI Summit to continue on with their day? No, I think one thing would be really cool, um, I don't know what your guys' plans are, but to circle up in six or 12 months and talk about, you know, what are the additional things we've learned and and what's been rolled out.

And I think more importantly than what's rolled out, Michael, is what is what is being monetized? What what are people actually paying for? So, that would be super interesting. I think we just froze a bunch, so I think we got to redo that part. Okay. Okay. Cool.

Um, just say from like the outro part again. Yeah. What I kind of just wing that. Do you Is there a preference the way I should do it instead? Um, no. You just do the same thing like do you have any final thoughts? Great.

Cool. All right. Anything that you wanted me to say and said, Kevin? No, that Well, I think what you said is fine. Great. Um, awesome, Kevin.

Well, thanks so much for uh for joining me today. Uh you know, I I think it's super valuable to to sort of see where AI is going and talk to people that are really leading the way there. Um before we sort of give the the fine people at the Talk AI Summit uh time back uh you know, let them go on with their day, any final thoughts you have on on where AI where Mango Voic is going with it, anything there? Well, first of all, Michael, great job today. um you did an awesome job and uh appreciate the questions. Appreciate you guys, you know, including Mango in this important topic.

Um I I think what would be super interesting would be to circle up in six or 12 months from right now. Yeah. And basically go back to this conversation and say, you know, what have you learned over the last 12 months? What what products have you launched? You know, we're excited about some products we're going to launch. um this year um specifically around AI um and I'd love to talk more about what we've learned from that. And I think the cool thing is is not only launching a new product, but when customers actually pay you for that because that's when you know you have product market fit, which is a sweet spot.

So, love to circle back up with you. Uh maybe talk deeper about that. But, uh yeah, I until then, we'll just keep grinding on this AI thing and see if we can crack the code. Can't even imagine what will happen in 12 months. That's That's like gonna be a whole different world that we live in.

Yeah, potentially. Yeah. Well, excited to talk then, Kevin, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Hey, thank you. [Applause] [Music].
