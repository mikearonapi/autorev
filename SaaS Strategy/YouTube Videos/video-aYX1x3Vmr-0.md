and increasingly that next generation of companies is going to be built kind of extending on that value proposition means you're able to distribute the products in the context of where your users are already spending time so you're not asking users to learn a new user experience or have to go log in to get another app when they've already got dozens of apps to log into you're kind of extending on the workflow where they already live you're able to get value more quickly because you're able to build off of places where data already resides and folks are already actively working and you can potentially play the role of connecting systems and create a lot of stickiness in the user workflow as this part of that [Music] [Applause] our sponsor is partner Insight your AI copilot to grow your Partnerships 3x faster onboard and collaborate with Partners from one shared platform seamlessly exchange and track deals content and data you say I do automate engagements track progress create reports or answer frequent partner questions try partner insight for free hi Kyle great to have you yeah great to be on I've been following you a very long time on LinkedIn and also following your newsletter Rose and hinged and the work you've been doing on open EO you you've done incredible job coining the term product LED girls in 2016. this uh movement just blowing up and increasing the scale really incredible so I'm really looking forward to to discuss today how product light grows interacts these Partnerships because I think there's a misconception that they are mutually exclusive but I think they're not but to kick things off I would love to ask you what is the latest definition of product like growth and uh could you explain like product life grows to me as if I'm if I'm your new friend who has nothing to do with B2B SAS like how how would you explain it I joined openview in 2016 uh which is the year The Firm coined the term product would growth it was coined by a colleague of mine Blake Bartlett and he was essentially looking at companies uh both in our portfolio and companies that we wish we would have invested in and they were rewriting the playbook for how to grow a software company and I think the most useful way to describe product LED growth is to kind of emphasize what it's not and the the old Playbook was uh will higher up a very big sort of outbound SDR bdr team they'll get a list of potential buyers in a space they'll call up set up meetings and then you know maybe qualify folks hand them off to an AE there's going to be multiple stakeholders involved both on the customer side and on the this uh in in inside of an organization looking at you know maybe three six months buying processes lengthy time with procurement Finance legal and so on and then a multiple month period of implementation and setup and it might take nine months before end users ever get their hands on a product and now what's happening is that that kind of buying experience is being turned on on its head end users are going out and discovering products that they think are going to make themselves or their teams more effective they're finding those products landing on their website signing up trying them out themselves they're often putting in real work into setting up products without any sort of financial commitment no price point at that point because most of these products have a free trial or free game offering they're buying the initial buying process might be via self-serve on a credit card and then they're going and going to bat to their their leadership their CFO say hey we're seeing a lot of value in this tool we want to adopt it more widely uh and what's happening in this phenomena of product like growth is it's an end user focused buying experience and it's instead of thinking about growth happening as a result of sales or marketing or very manual and resource intensive and activities it's trying to take more of those activities and bringing them into the product experience which can provide a really consistent customer experience and can be really scalable right because once you set it up you're not uh paying you know on a uh you're not having to pay armies of people to go kind of do repetitive activities it's all built into the product sounds very easy but much harder in practice exactly have you been doing product like girls sort of in in partner inside ourselves no it's not trivial to pull this off but at the same time I think what is interesting last year right in one of your blog posts you you mentioned age of connected work right and I think just yesterday I was talking with the company which is not doing any direct sort of sales motion they only sell either through marketplaces or through Partners um can you talk a little bit more about how do you see what is the main Trends how product-led growth is evolving in the age of connected work it's been something we've been thinking about a lot um centrally productive growth has become a very hot term a lot of folks are looking for ways to incorporate it in their in their business so we're thinking you know what comes next what's after product LED growth and what's the next evolution of like how can companies stand out right if everyone has a free version everyone has a self-service experience uh how can you continue to innovate and what we're realizing is you know the average company has dozens if not hundreds of software tools right those often live independently um they they've been maybe big Investments you know you have your sales force around you know CRM and the sales Tech stack you've got HubSpot investment or other kind of Port marketing Technologies you've got four core Investments around Cloud infrastructure with AWS or TCP or Azure you've got all these kind of big purchases um and their cloud-based products and increasingly that next generation of companies is going to be built kind of extending on that value proposition which is uh going to be in a way that actually means you're able to distribute the products in the context of where your users are already spending time so you're not asking users to learn a new user experience or have to go log in to get another app when they've already got dozens of apps to log into you're kind of extending on the workflow where they already live uh you're able to get value more quickly because you're able to build off of places where data already resides and folks are already actively working and you can potentially play the role of connecting systems uh and create a lot of stickiness in the user workflow this part of that so in in our mind this age of connected work concept is saying we were all already adopting a ton of software products but it actually is not fully productive yet because it's a disconnected experience we want to bring these together uh into something that is actually seamless built for end users um and makes turns all of that technology into actual business value I promise not to dig too deep on Partnerships but uh I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you about a couple of changes that you articulated uh in in in your recent you know newsletters and blog posts about this age of connected works a lot of times that I found sort of fascinating is that building for openness and you you mentioned that companies need to build for openness can you elaborate on that it kind of goes back to this concept that I mentioned around this yeah this age of connected work connected systems uh and it's it's all that openness and interconnectivity and so and maybe I'll kind of like just bring in some examples to help demonstrate what I'm thinking of so uh let's say you're an e-commerce company you've made core Investments on Shopify right uh that's kind of the core Foundation right you're going to enroll the business this Shopify has a fairly open ecosystem strategy they have a massive Marketplace in fact more of their revenue comes from Merchant Solutions rather than selling their core software in the first place so Shopify has this extremely open attitude towards technology vendors because they know that that actually builds a whole ecosystem of sort of stickiness and solves a lot of problems for customers that Shopify is just not going to have the bandwidth to build all themselves and but from an ecosystem partner standpoint it means that if they can get connected into that Shopify ecosystem and distribute through the Shopify App Store customers can essentially art take all of The Upfront setup work that they've done in Shopify and getting and starting to sell products that way and they can essentially translate all that hard work into immediate value on incremental products that they buy so if they now want to buy email marketing tools if they want to buy SMS uh sort of related software technology if they want to buy technology drop shifting shipping and referrals all of that can extend upon the data uh the setup they're kind of all all of their existing systems in Shopify so there's openness both from a Shopify perspective and from a vendor perspective of folks that are Distributing through Shopify as their core partner and it's this uh openness that allows for customers to to I think realize the the magic of products like growth because um it's it's really all about removing friction uh from that user experience in order to get value even faster for a customer actually I wrote a case study on Shopify some time ago and I realized that Shopify bags on Wednesday status is a prioritize API and kind of via this ecosystem approach pretty much from the from the very beginning so they won against their competitors uh introductive quality of API the exposed and developers wanted to to work with them because of that and and so on so I think thank you for sharing your insights um going back to what you just said which I found very interesting um talking about going where customers are there's two ways to do that well I mean there's many ways to do that but like two prominent ways to do that one of them is to go to marketplaces and sort of third-party platforms like Shopify for example another one would be I think you mentioned grammarly in one of your um in one of your uh talks uh which is uh working sort of everywhere right in browser and in other server uh embedded applications uh from from you standpoint where do you see companies that tilting are like uh how they are sort of uh utilizing those those those motions today it starts with understanding who your user is and where they're spending time and what what systems they're already using and so if you're selling into a for instance uh a knowledge worker they tend to spend a lot of their time in the browser and in particular at Google Chrome and if you can distribute through the Chrome sort of extension and chrome chrome ecosystem Marketplace that you're able to provide something that works really wherever your users are working they're not having conscious they decide whether to log in uh or to the product or not the product just happens to work wherever they need it and that's I think the power of grammarly you know which is at its core of Chrome extension obviously they have a lot of extensions and they sort of work wherever people right but with grammarly the idea is uh let's help people just write much better and in a seamless way instead of just having spell check or autocorrect like let's actually help people write in a way that's compelling and people are writing in a lot of different places right so it you're not just writing in Microsoft Word or Google Docs but those are certainly two places where that you could be writing you might be writing emails in Gmail you might be writing inside of other software applications like an Asana or you know you name it and so grammarly by living essentially within Chrome within your browser they're going to help you improve your writing anywhere that you mean that help and they're going to do that without you having to remember to log into grammarly right if you had to seek out grammarly anytime you needed help with writing something you'd probably just not go for that extra pain unless it was something really important but because grammarly is just sort of natively embedded where you already are it's something that gets you value really quickly it gets sticky kind of repeatable use usage and habit formation from the user it just doesn't require a whole lot of friction for their user experience but this good this uh looks different for a lot of different companies right so there's the Chrome extension and kind of chrome Marketplace is a very popular place for folks to distribute products but you can also look at the app store for for products that are distributed over mobile uh and you know that's that's an increasingly popular place even for B2B products Shopify App Store kind of building on top of Shopify if you're an e-commerce uh the list actually goes on I know that you know uh even at Lassie and for example has a very massive uh Lassie and App Store a lot of the large tech companies do and so if you're uh person or like AWS has has a very large Marketplace as well depending on your persona it might be really compelling to tap into that ecosystem uh because you're gonna just be able to provide a better product uh that actually can utilize product like growth without a whole lot of disruptive behavior change expected from your users this leads uh very nicely to to another question that I had is around sort of on the opposite side right when when companies in bed in someone else's software those software can start monetizing indirectly as well and this is like a pretty big trends across the industry to to embedding and monetizing not necessarily even like your own product but monetizing some customer is a workflow or data or anything else can you talk a little bit more on that you called it out yeah it's uh there's a lot of benefits to to doing that from uh kind of large software vendor standpoint of having that Marketplace allowing uh easy connectivity and then being able to monetize indirectly as as part of that my experience was given where we sit so I work at a VC firm we invest in earlier stage companies often series a series B these are not the companies that yet you know have the market power and the customer base where they're building out their own marketplaces so they're more on the side that is Distributing through other folks marketplaces uh but I mean to me the the rationale as a vendor is pretty obvious right your customers you well you have a a massive install base of customers they have very diverse needs that might be different across Industries or personas your product has become core to how they operate and so they want to extend what they're how they're using it to get even more business value from from the product and that could mean a road map that could be infinitely long roadmap and so you could go build and you know a product engineering work that's massive and you know a huge percentage of your Revenue to build all of those things but a much more efficient way would be to have a more open ecosystem approach partner with other isvs and developers where you might have your own first party apps and then your uh your partners could distribute apps to the App Store and that way you're really allowing faster Innovation you're allowing the market to see what folks really value uh and and they want and so you're able to provide I think more solutions to customers in a faster way and you're able to be efficient because you're not having to spend as as much money building out your R D team in-house you can benefit essentially from third party r d on your platform and then there's still a really powerful modernization opportunity through charging as a percentage of Revenue or through other avenues because you're getting a rake on any of these purchases happening through your platform uh and then what can be powerful is your vendors might even start bringing you customers right or your customers are going to be sticky it's going to be very hard for them to leave and go to another platform because not only are they using your software they're using a host of apps around your software uh which is uh which just means that it's going to be extremely difficult for them to replicate that experience elsewhere or might take a lot of time for them to do it so I mean a lot of benefits uh but it also is something that requires a pretty dedicated investment to go do this well building a developer friendly API first business with Partners is extremely different from building a direct to customer business that sells your software products firsthand uh it's a it's almost like building kind of two businesses within one totally I wrote a case study on slack and uh slack made his decision pretty early on as well right so to be a platform effectively to uh to build a ecosystem around it and surprisingly when Salesforce requires slack uh that the devaluation was I think 10x difference between slack and Salesforce as a time of acquisition uh but the number of uh developers in the community was only two times difference so like slack has so many people engaged in the ecosystem was really incredible thank you so much for for sharing that the question that probably a lot of people who think about Partnerships like a system or platform even sort of askings himself is it's not it's not Eve question it's one question right and I think it would be interesting to hear your opinion one is a sort of a good time or like what is this maybe like signals always a good time to to start thinking about it so maybe like testing some some approaches because I think you you are at the point when in open you you see so many companies right in your in your portfolio and drones uh around the ecosystem when they think it's it's a good time is it like um did they start thinking about it is it it's serious a is it before is it after like well it's going to be different depending on the company and you know it goes back to where your users spend time and what's going to be the best way to reach them I mean there are some companies I would say especially on the Shopify App Store example uh there's some companies where they know from really the very beginning that that core to their strategy is going to be a close partnership with Shopify and distributing through Shopify and through Shopify partners and that's just you know that is their focus from day one it's also a great way to build a wedge right because they can focus on one eCommerce platform all of the integration sort of making that experience as seamless as possible scaling within that kind of core ICP and then maybe they can replicate that to the other e-commerce platforms as they reach scale and they want to diversify and kind of reduce the platform risk uh but there's there's going to be a lot of nuances across companies and so it's really hard to pinpoint when is the right time to do it in my mind for a lot of companies it can be core to how they go to market kind of from the very beginning and so if that's true you really want to start thinking about it maybe even before you monetize uh and then there's there's going to be other folks where this partnership motion is actually more about extending something that's already worked at a direct level and with that they've gotten into repeatable fashion right so they found a way to build a product that people love and find a scalable way to reach those folks um maybe they're at kind of series C Series D at that point but looking for incremental channels to layer on to inflect even faster growth at scale and so if you're if you're not doing it as kind of core to that business model and it's more about secondary drivers I see it as something that where you want to wait until you have that kind of product go to market fit before you start trying to layer on too many incremental channels and growth levers very good points uh very good point we did um episode with Danielle from uh from atlassian he he working at lesson before and we talk about uh how Partners potentially can help uh this sort of product that grows Motion in general and I think he's he's Insight was that Partners actually can give you almost like 10x of feedback right so you if you if you do if you build in products and do it to the product like grows you you you're trying to get feedback and trying to see like what sticks and like how you would you know improve the product to generate more sort of retention or like uh adoption and so on and I think Partners if you if you feel the company which is working with sparklers you can you can get a lot of feedback from Partners not only in scale but in terms of quality as well it's it's sort of unique uh and and so on so what do you think about it do you see companies actually a new experience or like in your in your portfolio are they trying to get feedback from Partners as a way to to improve the the product it's hard to Define this because of all the nuances and variety involved what I would say is uh there's certainly a number of companies where Channel partners and and specifically thinking about like reseller kinds of Partners or agency types of Partners in in this case uh where that's a really efficient way to reach the End customer right so if you're selling a solution around it management two smbs uh nsmb might have an I.T person in-house that buys those products but oftentimes they actually have nmsp managed service provider and outsourced I.T and so if you could sell to the MSP you could actually potentially reach all of their customers right but you're selling to one one person who can become an expert in your product and can uh and once you've sold that one deal you've sold not just one to one customer but to all of their customers and to any new customer that they're going to deploy to so it can be really efficient way to grow and you also have that one entity that essentially is collecting all of that Insight from across their customer base distilling it based on kind of their expertise and then sharing that with you and so anything that comes through filtered through that process you already know hey this isn't just one-off feedback from one customer that might be different from all of my other customers this is from someone that's really put the time and effort into my product that is committed and so you could you could normally trust it a lot more and kind of put more stock into it uh but for for software companies for a lot of time a lot of times when you're early on and I'm thinking particularly around series a series B it's hard to have both a direct to customer motion and that Channel or agency partner motion and have them both humming at the same time like didn't add their agency partner program until a little bit later on and so it's not impossible but a lot of times my focus tends to be let's find where we're gonna find that best traction initially whether that's a direct model or a partner related model let's nail that scale it and then we'll find those incremental channels and that way you're not diluting your efforts and kind of trying to build up two different teams and two different motions and get two different kinds of feedback from customers uh when you are too early to have found that kind of repeatable motion that that you can scale and so then you're you're really just diluting your efforts by and not nailing one thing yeah I think you're right so it's you you either partner focused from the beginning right like like companies like crowdstrike for example they they they've been doing this through Partners or you you're trying to get your foot in the door in the market sort of product market rate and then you try to expand your sister Partners some companies like uh airtable or like Asana they tend to find some some partner feeds with uh At Last Time by the way as well uh but but but but but you're right so you need to figure out how do you get direct feedback from customers probably first and then then probably like scale it through social partners and improvements awesome uh you you've been recently um writing about product blood growth and sales and uh I would love to maybe like us touch uh on on that a little bit and then uh and then I think we we would then uh our discussion with this community is because I think it's it's been fascinating like how communities are driving grows these days right it's also like very difficult but but still communities are becoming very very prominent so going back to product like growth and sales what is the trends that you've seen there I mean sort of apart from from Partners one of the trend is just everyone's trying to figure out how to do both at the same time right there was this big battle at one point of like it's either product like growth or it's sales and where people have realized it's really kind of just about every company is challenged to do both uh over time it's maybe you nail one first but as you're at scale you kind of got it at both for plg companies you might have started with that and user Maybe started with a self-serve Channel that's doing well but that yourself serve users are starting to maybe call into support saying hey I need help with a security questionnaire I need some help with I need a contract I need I'm looking at rolling this out across a wider group in my CFO has questions and if you don't have a sales rep you're going to often miss out on that opportunity uh which you know provides not the best customer experience and can also really stall your ability to grow because you want to grow from that user to team to company-wide adoption and so for plg companies often it's starting with that base of plg as the core foundation and then layering in sales to go work with those existing users in order to expand their that both their usage and their overall spend and with that product LED sales approach I think that the Nuance for me is that you're selling to someone that is already using your product often or to an account at least that's already using your product which can accelerate the sales process right you don't have to qualify them demo to them right it's you're working with someone that maybe is already advocating for you and you can kind of partner with that power user or Champions I have an account and it's also something where you have a lot more data to Bear uh on this process so you know who's using the product how they're using the product when usage is growing when usage is shrinking uh all of the different users in an account you should ideally be able to leverage that data to sell to the right Accounts at the right time in a way that's personalized to how they use the product that's you know easier to say than it is to actually do in reality but that you can actually unlock this personalized buying experience because you have the data to then personalize the experience the other thing that I would say is for for these plg companies you need to have an Enterprise grade product that you can sell right so you don't want to layer in in sales without having that incremental product that you can sell that is just you know frankly better for than the self-serve product experience like the gives the folks a reason why they should be engaging with sales in the first place uh and then you also need to make sure the incentives are right because you could layer on a sales rep that customer could buy self-serve so do you give sales credit on that or is it is it a self-serve deal like there could be a lot of friction points between the and channel conflict between the two uh the final thing I'd say is a lot of plg companies start with that end user and solve for you know band users can actually adopt the product but when you start getting into Enterprise selling in larger accounts that power user might not be the one who can write the check and so you're often multi-threading in an account asking for an intro to the decision maker trying to educate the decision maker what's the business value that you're generating for them and that can actually just be it sounds straightforward to traditional software companies like that's just normally core to have selling software works but for plg companies that's not baked into the DNA messaging on the website doesn't speak to that kind of Roi based message for the decision maker you might not have a you know have any sort of account based marketing to get to the decision maker Beyond you know sales sales touch points and so it's it's all things that the plg families need to learn over time in order to get good at this motion but then for sales ad companies it's actually normally layering in a plg motion uh to broaden their addressable Market opportunity and improve the customer experience but doing that in a way that doesn't create too much conflict right because as soon as they introduce a freemium Edition for example sales reps you might hate that because all of a sudden these folks that would have to you know contact sales and do a demo might just start using the product which might be an opportunity that they miss out on at least in the short term uh and so there's there could be a lot of of challenges I guess in my mind going from product led to then attic sales is a little bit easier than going from traditional kind of sales approach and then adding plg but there's complexities under both sides thank you so much for for sharing your thoughts are things that are sort of going into the same the conversion in the same space almost right I think product Labs companies are have to be budgeting product because otherwise people will not adopt it at all people who could sort of come in from sales uh but in sales but they still I mean I think there's a sort of equalizing each other now in the markets uh I think product LEDs companies creating much better standards in terms of like quality of the product but but I think what I found very insightful in your in your in in what you said is that um like real value actually is unlocking Enterprises and teams right so like a real value in terms of like uh getting into large volume of sales large evaluation and so on you you have to unlock selling to teams it's selling to Enterprises and this is like not too well and this is an interesting segue uh to maybe like a Json question related to Cloud marketplaces you mentioned AWS and gcp obviously Azure and so on I think what they've done really well they found a way to streamline the selling experience for procurement Department right and I think this is like their big value proposition and I think now they edit like partners and they created like private offers so you can actually sell non-standard terms but I'm sort of curious what do you what do you make of this or was this just explosion of uh this hyperscaler it's probably hard to comment overlay on that I think from a from a vendor standpoint if I go back to that startup mentality if you are trying to sell to a customer and and deploy you know on their AWS like as part of their AWS uh sort of purchase and and you know maybe Deploy on their cloud it might be a lot of work to navigate all of the different kind of buying processes of selling into a large Enterprise but you're but ultimately the the purchase that you're trying to get the customer to make might be a six-figure purchase but it's like a fraction of the customer spend on AWS as a whole and so if you could instead sort of sell as part of that same AWS broader agreement that's kind of already signed off already approved maybe as part of that already committed spend that the customer has made you can Turbo Charge that sales cycle by potentially two or three months um and really get in proved value and then grow with that customer and so it's uh I think it's a really interesting opportunity for companies that sell into that developer and I T Persona to try to basically ride off of the coattails of the big cloud vendors uh and you know use that as a way to get into Enterprise customers in a way that's much more efficient than trying to sell each of these customers one by one well I totally agree with you I think that the big carry out of that expectations should be managed appropriately because I think a lot of companies feel that it was a list on marketplaces they will get discovered a lot but this is not it's not uh the value proposition of big marketplaces yet I think they they will probably grow but but now you still need to bring your own basically client and would say hey here's my product here's the easy way to to buy it through your um your existing contract like you said totally Discovery is so it's a fascinating thing on marketplaces there are some marketplaces that are really great at disk edit kind of driving discovery of the apps on their Marketplace I would say the cloud Giants are probably not so great at that uh maybe there's just too too much noise too many of them uh oftentimes like where you're going to be able to drive that discovery is if your product solves the Strategic Gap for that vendor that their customers are asking for right so if customers are starting to churn because a vendor doesn't have X right or if getting X is keyed for that large vendor to unlock a big opportunity within it within a customer you're going to be strict your app is going to be really strategic to them uh and so that's where if you can be in that position where you're strategic that big vendor is going to actually be very incentivized to bring you into deals to do co-marketing with you to feature you in their content on the in their events in their community and so on and so you can you know if you're in the right place at the right time with the right product you can drive a lot of Discovery through those larger vendors 100 degree uh did you happen to have any examples from from your portfolio one company I featured in growth unhinged uh my newsletter is a company called super metrics which uh initially was a kind of a data connector built off of Google Sheets uh for for Market right it's now much broader product that can connect data across a lot of different systems but one of the initial pain points was you've got as a marketer you've got data that lives in a lot of different systems you might have add data that lives in Facebook you might have Google analytics data from your website um you might have email data that lives in your HubSpot instance and so for marketers to kind of bring that all into one place and often as they wanted that that destination to be Google Sheets it was a lot of like manual copying and pasting every week every month and you wanted just all of that data to be fed into one source and it automated so it was accurate you had it when you needed it it's consistent and it saved you time and so with super metrics they could actually become very strategic for players like Google because Google wasn't going to be able to build super close Integrations with their sworn enemies right with the Facebooks of the world but so a neutral vendor that could play the role of connector between different parties could actually end up making Google's ecosystem much more valuable and and drive more folks maybe into Google Sheets or into using Google analytics or that Suite of Google products uh and so to me that's a that's a good example of kind of being in that right place at the right time I think they also were one of the first vendors that launched as part of Google's workspace Marketplace and so they've kind of benefited from taking a bet on a Marketplace that wasn't yet proven uh that didn't have a whole lot of customers but where they could be early and then you know because they were early kind of get that Halo from being uh the first to market leader great example great example uh knowing that we we only have limited time I would love us maybe like to to wrap up uh on on the topic of communities and sort of ecosystems and specific communities right I think communities could be very powerful and you wrote about communities a lot but at the same time communities as a topic and uh Focus probably have been overused to some extent I would love your maybe like the latest take on where we are in terms of companies using communities what is the best practice and what would be your advice for companies sort of in 2023 well it is a buzzword right a lot of people talk about community but that what they actually mean it's very different depending on the company there's so many different varieties of a community strategy there's also a lot of folks that you know have a community orientation or a desire for Community strategy but don't see a whole lot of outcomes around that they can attach to the community strategy um so in my mind there's a few different flavors for plg companies one is again finding where your users already are where they're already spending time and being active in those communities so if we can go back to that e-commerce and Shopify example if you're Distributing through Shopify on that app store there's actually a much broader Community within Shopify that you can tap into there's a number of Shopify agencies and partners Shopify related events and meetups um you know go be present within those communities before you start looking to kind of build your own first party Community because that you're going to be able to take advantage of infrastructure that's already there and that kind of core party's credibility uh you're going to have a bigger kind of impact in a shorter period of time if you do that but then there's a lot of different nuances as you kind of move up from there to start building out that first party community and I think of it back to like what are who is your user and what do they need to be successful so there are some companies that are in newer categories uh or or have a new kind of way of operating that's very forward-thinking and where they they have a belief that that market for what they're doing is going to be growing over time and that people need help figuring it out and they want to connect with peers they want to learn best practices software vendors can play that role of that kind of category Creator uh at any HubSpot did an amazing job with this with you know that concept of inbound marketing which wasn't just things that they wrote about but you know communities they built around how to do inbound marketing I started seeing job postings right for inbound marketing uh in the plg space I'm a big fan of Pocus which is a product LED sales software company because of their product LED sales community which is on slack they have I think bi-weekly virtual meetups with experts in their Community they're really great about featuring any of those insights from those uh those meetups and kind of turning them back into content uh that are then valuable for everyone in the community and it's one of those things where we're all trying to figure out how to do plg and sales sales leaders are figuring it out PL product folks are figuring it out and so Pocus gets to play that interesting role of connector and facilitator which is just so valuable right now that that is not going to be as valuable for a company that's selling into a category that already exists right with the Persona that's already very well you know very mature and isn't looking for that kind of guidance or already has plenty of resources out there uh the final thing I would say is what's a a final sort of trend that I've observed for 2023 and you know I'd also count this as a trend from the last couple of years there are so communities are are often great or media companies I should say are great at building a community building an audience doing it very efficiently uh not spending a lot of money on it right media companies historically aren't great at monetizing uh but they have a lot of trust Independence neutrality and they can build a very large and trusted audience software companies on the other hand are great at monetizing but not so great at building audiences Community thinking long term right and so we've seen a number of instances of software companies either partnering with or even acquiring communities in their space that are really core to that Persona like pendo in mind the product is a great recent example I might even think of like panel and profit well um profitable is obviously more than just a community but uh I think of it as that kind of example where uh there's a really interesting kind of synergy between those two kinds of companies uh and so I I find that something that I'm expecting to see more of over the next couple of years yeah thank you so much for sharing great examples and I totally agree that software companies tend to be much better in building software Community sort of media companies uh have additional value that that and that's why all these Acquisitions happening I think HubSpot uh acquires the hustle hustle yeah and then so on I would love I would love us to cheer up on on the question what are you excited about 2023 uh and what are the things that's coming coming along in your newsletter which is gross engaged and also in open you you build your communities and stuff like that can you talk a little bit more what what kind of keeps you up and diets for 22 history I mean the market so there's always a reason to kind of go out observe what's going on try to kind of figure things out and help folks through it and kind of share perspectives on it and see you know my focus and our broader focus is trying to meet with the companies that are innovating doing interesting things on the bleeding edge but have something that you know has a Playbook that a lot of other people could learn from and try to take those insights and share them back and so that we kind of get stronger as a community about understanding how to do products like growth and just how to find modern ways of building great software businesses and so we're doing that in a few ways I mean on growth unhinged most of the newsletter is about finding experts out there being able to tell their stories but then we we also launched an openview plg Mastermind Community which is a cohort based Community for early stage Founders that are all thinking about how to set up and optimize their product like growth motion and we have sessions for them around the core principles of plg and we brought in outside experts to kind of facilitate those with both initially kind of some best practices and training but then just broader kind of knowledge sharing trading notes and Community discussions so that uh early stage Founders who are really kind of in their own company you know seeing that kind of that perspective about their specific product they can have access to this broader group of people that are at non-competitive products and companies that are actually going through the exact same process as they are I really appreciate you sharing all of this inside so I I love uh following your LinkedIn I think you you've been doing a lot of sort of assuring uh uh Snippets of information but but but to your newsletter is is is really fantastic so I would I would really recommend everyone to to to
