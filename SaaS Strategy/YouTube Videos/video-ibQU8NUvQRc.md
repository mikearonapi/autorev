foreign [Music] bar and welcome back to another episode of SAS District in today's episode we'll be talking about how to combine a community-led growth and a product like World strategy and today we have our guest Zachary DeWitt joining us Zach is the partner at Wing Venture Capital they are firm that invest in Sea and series a rounds for transformative Enterprise tank companies prior to Wing Zach was CEO and co-founder of a company called drop which built two award-winning iPhone apps drop messages and Firefly before they sold the technology and the IP to Snapchat in 2016. Zach also holds a ba in economics from the Yale University as well as an MBA from Harvard Business School so welcome Zach super excited to hack on the show today yeah thank you so much for having me I'm a big fan of the show and a lot of your content so it's great to make the connection and excited to chat with you thank you thank you likewise Zack um so a lot of exciting stuff to hear impressive resume but before we get into the nitty-gritty like just let's start from the top Community lead growth I mean that seems to be a Hot Topic these days people love it but uh can you give us a quick you know background what exactly that means and and how does that compare to product like product lead growth when it comes to SAS yeah absolutely so community-led growth is a powerful immersion go to market strategy that's gaining momentum in a startup community so what do we mean by community-led growth um the way I think about it is community-led growth is a go to market strategy in which companies build and Foster vibrant communities of passionate users and customers who ultimately become Advocates and influencers so you can think about this instead of relying on your product to do the selling or your sales team to do the selling you almost rely on your users and your community to do the selling and so how what are some ways in which a community can help the business so I think there are many so you know one of them is customer acquisition right and in today's world we tend to trust people more than we trust Brands so social proof matters a lot and it's a very valuable currency if you go on Twitter and you see people talking about how much they love notion or how much they love figma you may try this product simply because you're seeing an online trusted Community talk about it so these referrals matter um you know it's valuable social currency it's a signal of strong community-led growth uh and it's a way to spread the product um you know across your community and there's certainly we can talk into some strategies how to do that um you know companies like notion for example they have structured programs where they build community Advocates and they have referral programs and so they actually incentivize users to do that um but we can talk more about that later and so just going back to you know why does community-led growth matter and and what's its benefit so another benefit in addition to custom summer acquisition is upselling right so communities often helped Drive engagement and they come together they share best practices they share their content they share those success stories their templates and this just creates you know more materials more use cases removes friction for users as they go deeper into the product and they're more likely to try new features and upgrade to a more premium package certainly it helps with customer support too you know oftentimes like Tesla for example is a really strong Community you can argue it as community-led growth and you know Tesla a lot of the how to's are and and the forums online are powered by users so if you want to figure out how why your windows stuck you're probably going to read a forum that a user generated that content for as opposed to Tesla generated themselves and lastly a huge benefit of community-led growth is product feedback a vocal Community is not shy about sharing their product feedback both in public and in private like in slack channels so you just have a tighter feedback loop you know with your user base when you have a very Vibrant Community so we're moving from sales LED which is your team doing is selling to product LED which is your product doing the selling the community-led which is going Beyond product LED growth and and it's it's more than just your product even selling it's your community doing the selling and really supercharging them with with passion and advocacy for your product and Company interesting to use the notion as an example so you mentioned their Community um they're actually you know um rewarding their Community to to refer and get out more customers so I look at that more of like you know Affiliates or ambassadors or Channel Partners I guess you can call those I would think that would be between also you know plg and community-led because I think it'll be more of a transactional right like here's a link sign up it's such a good product whereas here you're saying you know the community is you know actually using the product they're sharing sharing case studies how they're actually using it um it's a lot more intimate not just the the transactional way would you would you agree with that I do agree absolutely and so you're right it's a very gray area between what is product LED and some of that maybe referrals both in-app referrals or external referrals or links um and then it's a gray area into what is actually community-led and so it may be like notion you can go to you can Google you know notion ambassadors and the whole notion ambassador program you know it says their passionate volunteer enthusiasts who teach and share notion with others and some of those Ambassador programs are paid and some of them are volunteer so I know notion has different levels of programs and so I think for their notion ambassadors program they are free uh so there are volunteer they're not paid but they're but notion equips them with materials right so notion gives them you know special um um you know admin access to the community Forum so they can they can put their posts towards the top or they can moderate their communities right so so part of what I think is powerful about community-led is actually tagging and identifying your power users you know who's naturally who's who's organically um community educating and speaking up most in a lot of your online community forums and then and then empowering them with materials with support with kind of a dedicated person you can talk to if they're questions to Spread spread the good word even more so I think you're spot on or there is a bit of a gray area where product-led growth um stops and Community growth starts uh and and there's certainly a spectrum yeah imagine what would happen if you started like instant so I love the idea of using you know volunteers people actually generally like want to spread word I think that's the best way but you know if you start adding incentives with you know cash into that I wonder how that that changes the whole dynamic in the mind but yeah and you can feel it on Twitter too I mean we've all seen um you know people on Twitter where it feels like a promoted post right and and and that that is when um you know you kind of get turned off and your spidey sensors are tingling a little bit that this feels gimmicky or this feels like they're paid to do this and so yeah I mean part of it is authenticity and actually you know part of my thesis over the next decade is is Brands you know B2B Brands really need to have both transparency and authenticity and and so if you can really Empower your your true organic users um you feel that on Twitter and you see that sometimes or sometimes people say on Twitter what's the best tool for uh design for my small business and you just scroll through the comments and you see all these people like love canva love canva love canva figma's great love camera and you know and you can kind of get a sense of just the the natural passion uh and so that really um that authenticity I think you said it very well um is is super important to uh you know to be a part of your kind of program and your aspirations for your community yeah 100 authenticity I think in all aspects of life but even it's kind of hard to differentiate online sometimes right but if you can spot it that's that's important yeah exactly well said I mean you're right I mean you're kind of blurring the lines between Brands and people right and so I think that's what this movement is about you're you're becoming less of a brand who's talking to you um and talking down at you and you really want to become an authentic uh collection of people and collection of users that love your product and and that becomes the interface that becomes um you know kind of the experience layer uh for new users that's where they hear about the product that's where they get referrals for the product um so moving from kind of this creepy large monolithic brand to this organic warm natural um kind of user nebulous uh Community uh I want to challenge that thought around you know the old nebulous monolithic brand um doesn't that attract a certain type of folks too like I would think um you know folks you know let's say bigger companies um you know Fortune 50 Fortune 500 CEOs they would maybe look at that is better than those like you know it's kind of it's kind of reverse like psychology where it's like no they actually don't want the personality they want to see a big brand company and has all this you know it looks you know bigger than it looks like right yeah it's a good question so I think I think it depends on on the vertical right so if it's dealing with money um you know you can imagine a world where you want a very large monolithic organization a faceless organization like you know Bank of America right they're trusted um they have millions and millions of customers they've been around for you know through Acquisitions but you know 100 100 year plus um and so there's a lot of trust there um however if if it's a if it's a developer tool or if it's a productivity tool um you know you really want to to learn about that from users and then you want to troubleshoot it with other users right you want to um you know land on the Community page as opposed to um on kind of a page which is like the brand talking to you and and so I think again I think I think you're right and your instinct's right but it I would push back and say it's more uh on what you know kind of vertical dependent of um do you want a big trusted monolithic faceless brand or do you want more of a um Community uh kind of you know people first experience and and um in company yeah yeah it makes complete sense and do you think that um you know every SAS company out there should experience or think about using community-led growth or is there any specific you would say that you wouldn't suggest as this a channel to even look at or consider yeah great question and so there's certainly some companies who are really well set up for community-led growth any any company that has any product that has collaboration in it right and so whether it's internal collaboration with colleagues or external collaboration with customers or vendors or Partners those tools are great for community-led growth because there's natural virality in the user experience so this could be productivity tools this could be communication tools um this could be developer tools this could be open source projects so these areas are really right for community-led growth As you move to more traditional SAS for example I'm thinking like an HR product who sold to multiple stakeholders kind of top down that that's a little bit harder to the community like growth now I think it's still important to invest in the community and that's part of when I talk to large companies that's part of the message I'm telling them that hey Community really matters um and so even though it may be a top-down sales process with multiple stakeholders uh for for kind of you know like work days as you can imagine you know people still want to go on and see the community feel like people are using it feel like they can troubleshoot feel like they can ask questions and get quick responses um you know if you feel like people really value the service and so my advice is every SAS company should be invest in a community um it's just a question of of how aggressively and and kind of um you know what what tools of the community like Playbook you should start with um yeah that makes sense I guess if you don't have an internal tool to yeah talk to each other then that's one that's one way you probably can't look at but imagine there's so many different channels to build uh you know communities these days that I mean I mean even like a podcast itself right that's one way um that I think every every SAS company can do um and then in terms of you know results right um like you mentioned a few benefits so so it's at the beginning of the episode um can you share maybe some results of what you've seen maybe some metrics or a case study showing between like was there a company you guys worked with that you know uh between starting with product lead growth and may move towards um community-led and what was the results of you know before and after yeah so one of the companies that I work close to is a company called copy.ai which is an automated writing tool and platform and copy is it's still an early company it's uh you know we we led the series a last year so it's only a couple years old I think it's two and a half years old at this point but they're starting to really push into community-led growth there's a very vibrant Twitter Community there's a lot of um community members that post on Tick Tock organically to help troubleshoot the product so it's in early stages of moving to community-led growth and so your question on metrics is so what is that what does that mean in terms of metrics right what's the impact one we've seen a decrease in customer acquisition costs because um we see the the percentage that come in from Word of Mouth a referral is increasing and so that that that is your purest form of customer acquisition there's no uh paid um uh customer acquisition associated with with that user growth so we're seeing customer acquisition costs go down which is really important for lot of businesses because you're optimizing customer acquisition costs relative to kind of lifetime value that customer we're also seeing support costs go down and and so this is if people are filing tickets on zendesk um they can start to resolve it by asking other community members either on Twitter or on a forum and and so um the number of kind of customer service reps we're seeing that we need to hire is is stabilizing and actually they can spend their time on some of the high value more complicated questions and problems um where the community can kind of help each other out and answer some of the the lower hanging fruit questions um and then also we're just seeing more engagement across the board right when you have all these you know almost like um uh kind of cross uh user Network effects where um they're learning from each other they're creating templates they're posting about how they did something online uh or a new use case it just expands the surface area for other existing users and so that's been really powerful too in terms of seeing um you know that that plays out and seeing faster upsells and and upselling to uh you know team products sooner I'd imagine that the on top of you know cat dropping your your conversion rate might go up as well right too exactly yeah because that's a really good point yeah conversion rate goes up from free to pay yep yeah yeah um so interesting like so you mentioned you know Tick Tock as a community I wouldn't have thought of that for you know it's a company like copy to AI but um that's that's one place and he also mentioned a forum and Twitter or these things that you guys kind of thought I would say okay we've got this company we're not using Community right now here are some ways where we can start uh like okay we're gonna start writing content on Tick Tock rating content and then are we going to add these you know Twitter uh you know this this location and a forum that you know people can go and voice with what's going on and would rather just you know build built this and let it kind of flow in its own or how do you guys manage it great question yeah really good question I would say it's a mix I would say it's a bit of push and a bit of pull and so what I mean by that is um listen we wanted to invest in Twitter and so we started working with a few influencers to and that was paid to get the word out there um I think at that point um what we what we realized is hey this is starting in the spread like you know if we paid three influencers posting about it um you know some of their followers started using copy and they would post oh copy is a great way to to brainstorm an essay right for college or it's a great way to write about um you know a marketing blog post to my job and so we started seeing that spread organically and then and then there's things you can do like you can create little challenges on Tick Tock that go viral um you can send people swag you know so they can um you know wear a copy a hat in a video um you can you can kind of create um you know as I said some um some challenges and some incentives and so you you wanna you basically wanna put uh start a very small fire and just watch it for a little bit and see how you know see how it burns and see how it grows and then you can add more fuel to the fire and invest in those channels um in a bigger way so you know Twitter is the same way like we see Twitter uh all the time um people post about copy AI there's a user called islow his handle is hey he's low e-a-s-l-o he posts all the time about his favorite tools and so um he's posting all the time about how great copy is so the team got in touch with him and try to understand why and figure out his ultimate power user and figure out how can we create more people sharing like you did what caused you to share so you can kind of study some of this behavior and invest and then also we're going to invest in a forum as well um we want to use a modern Forum service right now we have a slack Channel with some of our users so just just giving them more Avenues um to communicate with other users and giving them more Avenues to communicate directly with the company and give them you know kind of giving them like a you know a hotline to to talk to the product leader or the CEO if anything comes up yeah that's that's super smart I like that strategy I wouldn't have thought Tick Tock but I mean I I'm actually not even surprised but I mean Twitter has been always been you know true and tested and you know SAS companies I find if you know how to find you know creative ways like you mentioned I think that could be great but if I'm a SAS company I'm okay I'm I'm just building out or whatever stage I'm in of my product development when should I start thinking about creating my community um maybe so maybe if you can give us some steps and it's like how can we do this right and make sure we we get to success here yeah it's a good question um so the first thing I I think you want to do is you want to see who are your power spreaders right and so who are people that are naturally sharing already um who are people that are posting often in forums and you want to have medians with that right so this is the research phase right so why do you love our product why do you feel compelled to to post about in our in our Forum why do you feel compelled to post about it on Twitter um what do you get out of it right and so and so really kind of understanding that psyche um and then you basically want to try to create programs that creates more ambassadors or more passionate users and so uh it may be a paid program where you go out to some of your power reviews and say Hey you know listen we'll set up the circle program for you or we'll set up this ambassador program for you we'll send you a bunch of gear we'll give you we'll give you tools and tips and material you can post about we'll give you you know sneak access to our upcoming product set and product launches make them feel really special and so I think I think that's that's really important um the other thing that that starts to happen is you start to see people actually creating on top of your platform so so you want to give people tools to build on top of your platform so you know I use notion as a conical canonical example of um of great community-led because uh growth because if you look at product hunt I would say every day I look at product and every day I have the app on my home screen on my phone every day there's one or two notion apps or notion templates that people are launching that is really powerful right so not only do they um evangelists and promoting notion and spreading a good word but they're actually creating content tools apps templates that make notion better for every other user so there's this compounding effect and so so part of it is notion their product is set up where people can build templates right their product is set up where people could build kind of custom plugins or custom apps and so I think you want to be able to um uh set up a product to do that right where you give users power you let them build on top of you let them share with their building figma does this really well they have their you can go to figma.com community um you can see all their their plugins that their users built um and so they they really showcase what the community is doing and giving them tools to do that so I think that's the second step is like once you set up this ambassador program this evangelist program um you you want to make your app and and and you're really making a platform where people can build on top um and so not a lot of apps do that figma notion we're only to that and I think we'll start seeing that a lot more and more no it makes sense um so if I'm maybe in the building stages and I'm thinking of sharing so I see this a lot right on some communities where people are often sharing updates to their their their platform and get people excited I guess you know things like superhuman and a few other you know great they've done a really good job with that um at what moment do you think is a good time to be sharing with the community to test you know and say okay hey we're here um and or hey we've got this new thing right I mean how often should you be doing this and keeping people of the community excited I think it's a great question I think with with your power users if you can get your power users into a slack Channel with you or a Discord Channel you want to be you want to be sharing product updates every other week you know maybe every week um just let them know you're building let them know you're responsive let them know you hear their feedback that's super important and then you know every company's got a different release Cadence for public releases so that may be every quarter that maybe every month you know and so I see a lot of early stage startups have very fast release Cycles um every month they're sending products email to their entire user base their new features hey we hear you we're here your feedback we're building for you and you really make the user feel heard right because if you think about this I mean really community community life growth is is making your product and experience a two-way street um we've all used products I mean I'm sure you use many SAS tools and um and your work you invest in tools and so you're constantly you you want improvements you want change I mean I want slack to do certain things I want super Community certain things um you know I want stripe to do certain things and so when you feel heard and and you feel like they're really responsive to your input it deep deepens your affection for that for that product and so closing like I think the best product like growth companies and the best community-led growth companies have a really tight feedback loop between product and community yeah let's feel you know the struggle there is I was like you know you don't want to be bothering these folks like I mean these people have you know their full-time jobs or whatever it is and I was like Hey like hey can you get you're asking for free I guess stuff right maybe you do give them some stuff and you know but you kind of feel like hey I'm wasting this person's time or like I'm asking them too much you know if you're every week and okay could give me feedback he can give me feedback how do you kind of think about that as a massage founder great question yeah and you really want to be careful not to push people too much or annoy people and so that's why I think if you can really observe who who who who are these super power users that that are always talking to you always posting feedback always sending tickets in um and and you can get a sense of like they're almost opting in through their behavior that they that they want to engage more and so that that's who you want to bring into this type community of kind of product of immediate product feedback so it's a really important point the other thing I'll say is that SAS tools today become our identity right like there's this movement of bring your own tool to work the average um tech company uses 50 to 60 SAS who will say according to the Octo work report and so these are these are tools that users want you know some users bring in slacks some you know some some users bringing Tome and some users bring in Tango I mean all these kind of emerging new compelling startups and they want to introduce it with their team and and they want to be first they want to hey I'm cool I'm going to know this is what other great startups are using other great teams are using um and so they take a lot of pride in it and it actually becomes who you are and becomes your identity and you know I've seen people on Twitter um post the tools they use in their bio right or so that's kind of just posted on LinkedIn all the time so you want to get into that like I think this is I think the best companies become Cults right like figma is a cult like you look at Twitter like people are ride or die figma people with figma tattoos when people start getting attacked like when people start getting tattoos for a SAS product like you've activated your community right and the other thing we haven't really talked about is events and so figma has done a great job with their VidCon their figma conference and bringing um you know users from all around the world to incredible cities to meet each other to talk about design to push design forward another great aspect that Community start doing is they actually help educate their user base so figma really values learning and education they're all these videos and figma's website where I can learn how to design I can learn best practices I can learn modern practices and what's kind of Cutting Edge and so reinvesting in our community giving them content I think is super valuable as well um so yeah you you know it's it's it's uh there's a lot of cool stuff going on with community and and people as I said you know people kind of get to cold stuff status and and that's that's a sign I want to invest in any company where there's people are getting a tattoo with uh with that company's logo yeah no doubt I mean that's also probably why Adobe decided to acquire figma as well I don't blame him that's a great deal yeah and I feel like that's the trend going to be right future is like show me a resume but part of that you gotta include like your Tech stack because like here's what I can use what I bring to the table I think that's going to be the future it's so it's Fascinating People take a lot of Pride today pride in it right I'm sure you talk to a lot of Founders and operators that are talking about their Tech stack and their tools and they're repeating and so it's it's very cool it's it's fun to fun to watch I mean it's really the consumerization of Enterprise that's a term people have been talking about for a decade but but just like people take a lot of pride in what consumer products they use what car they drive what t-shirt they wear what shoes they wear right um it's the same thing at work you want to express your identity at work what what presentation tool do I use what communication tool do I use what Dev tools do I use um that says something about me and say something about my style says something about mine you know yeah I guess like it's like you're you your work clothes right behind there this is how I dress all right that's interesting exactly exactly so so that's why it wasn't I what Aesthetics really matter to me too I mean I when I like it it it's I probably miss companies investment opportunities because of this but when I look at a company's website even if it's a seed company I hold it to a really high standard like do they have attention to detail you know do they have um is is the brand thoughtful does a brand stand for something um you know do they feature kind of their their community and their product right on the homepage right away and so it it's tough a lot of teams will say oh we're just a seed company we're just half together a website and and for me that's kind of a knock against the company if they haven't really put a lot of thought and Care into the the first experience the website the Aesthetics the color palette the logo like as you said you know people love their shoes they love their Nikes they love they love the Air Force Ones and and the Aesthetics really matter and so that I want to see that expressed in SAS brands that yeah that I could tell I can tell by your background just by the the level of detail in your your new branding I mean you can see we're not a SAS you're not Horizon Capital but we also you know that was something important to me so I feel you like our design everything had to be like you know on point so I mean a lot of investment companies don't care they're old it's old school they're like no this represents me I wanted to look good so I think totally yeah yeah Statics matter and so uh figma I mean I'm just like figma's website is I mean it's sexy right you know Notions of beautiful product these products are clean and they have a feel agenda move to them they've and that's um that's what we're going for you want to make products want to make their users feel a certain way right and so um that is the state of where we are in sash today it sounds it sounds a little bit silly but that's that's where we are in terms of kind of the next the next great set of startups I mean that's the basics of sales right making people feel connected to your brand I mean now we're just learning how to do it without you know people to people with the actual website so that's well said yeah yeah so so last question Zach before we get into the the kind of personal rapid fire questions um so you know building a community is one thing I find you know I'm probably pretty good at you know getting people in and you know having this huge list and um but then engaging them is another um from us uh what if I'm a SAS company product LED Growth Company I'm looking to build and keep that Community active engaged what are some actions you would recommend to take yeah it's a great question uh and so you know there's a standard Playbook we've talked about of of um having a tight Loop and communicating often and sending them you know product updates and um and certainly engage them on Twitter if someone tweets that you Tweet back at them and so there's a lot of the basics I think I think when companies go above and beyond of how to engage your community they keep it fun and they introduce it's like really it's surprised in July your customer and so they're hiding little nuggets in the product like one company I work with around around dot Co which is kind of a next-gen video chat they they introduce games into their product like it's not really a gaming product right but they wanted to keep it fun for people and earn video conferences um they they had little nuggets of like oh you know seat like um find and go seek you know we hid something in this product release like who can find it first right so surprising and Delight your your consumers if that that's something a friend would do right a friend a friend would mess around with you a friend would have a sense of humor um you know a friend a friend would uh you know would would keep it fun and light and make you laugh and and so the the best again like they they make they extend and expand the range of emotions that you experience using their product and and so I think that's something that that Brands would do because you're right you don't want to just send them the boring email every week every month and here's our product release like every Wednesday second Wednesday of the month no you want to make it fun you want to have you know beautiful content cool video but you want to make it mysterious you want to make it humorous you want to make it cryptic you want to you know have um have a little you know hide something inside the product on the find right and keep it fun and light and hide a little mini game and so um I I think we're starting to see that more and more people are really expressing their creativity and in terms of kind of product launches and releases and um just how they communicate with customers so that's that's uh you know that's kind of the next gen Cutting Edge stuff that we're seeing more of I like it I mean it sounds so simple kind of being a little bit more bold in your communication and but uh I mean it's it's tough I mean but most people think that you got to keep it simple just you know don't get to make it too personal but I love the idea of making like as you're talking to a friend and you're you're just you know make it but like I can see the struggle on both sides right it's tough but I mean I'd love to try it out yeah and especially today it's just noisy out there right I mean you see you pick any category and there's like five startups competing and so you have to do something different and I think the other thing is you have to stand for something like I think where companies get lost with communities they don't stand for something um they don't have values and like those uh I I heard a CEO talk of um of a very large private company recently um you know multi kind of deca corn company and he was saying that every single board meeting every single All Hands meaning they reiterate the company's long-term vision and the company's two or three strategic things they're working on this year everyone knows prioritize these two or three things this is what matters most and I think that really matters too when you're engaging customers and and consumers and users um you need to know what the brand stands for you need to know what their strategic vision is because oftentimes when I'm adopting a tool it's a series a or series B company I want to know if hey if I'm going to use this tool and spread it and be an evangelist like where are you head it I mean do we have the same values we have the same beliefs in five years are you headed in the right direction right and so so much of it is where you're going and so you need to you need to communicate that to users yeah that's awesome this is really good Zach I appreciate all you've shared here I think there's a lot of good insights for people to start applying yeah I'm excited to try it as well some of these things so all right it's ready to uh ready for the rapid fire questions yeah let's do it yeah let's do it all right Zach what's uh one activity you enjoy outside of work that gets you into Flow State um I love hiking with my wife I just being in nature actually leaving our cell phone behind really it's it you get into Flow State when you get your heart rate up um you know going uphill you just you stop thinking and you're really present and I listen I think we're all struggling to be present we're all inundated with notifications emails tools all the time especially as an investor you're constantly getting emailed and ping so yeah you got to get in a flow state I'm glad you asked about that it's uh I don't do it enough but that's probably where I get my deepest low State nice I see I gotta find a way how to be hiking while you're working and then you're older yeah exactly uh Zach what's one piece of advice you wish you had known and would tell your I'm going to change it to 20 year old self not 25 year old self what would you tell yourself so I I started a couple companies in my 20s but I never really went all in on them I only went all in on one where I that was my full-time job I stopped what I was doing I wish I started companies all in throughout my 20s every two year years I there's um in today's world uh there's so you know there's so much support for Founders um even if you fail um you know that you want to be backed again people want to work for you again um you just keep getting better and better and there's never been a better time to start a company so every every other year which I started a new company a new company new company if it doesn't work shut it down move on to the next just keep going um it's the most fun process in the world it's the most challenging process in the world and I wish uh you know I wish I did more of it I only did it once I should have done it four or five times what's uh what's stopping you from doing it now right it's a good question well I think the way to actually thread a needle as as a VC is I'm actually working on an incubation project right now which we can you know if we chat again next year we can talk more about um in kind of the go to market space so that's a great way to I'm doing all the research coming up with a branding coming up um you know kind of with the product of one of my colleagues and and that's a fun way to build something um you know but also still be able to invest because I'm so curious I love you know working with different projects and different Founders yeah I think with the same that way I get you yeah uh Zach what are some of the biggest challenges you guys are currently facing in order to continue to grow your your firm Wing partner Capital meaning you know if anything what keeps you up at night these days yeah it's a great question I I think the challenge is how best can we serve our Founders and so there's trade-offs right I mean we're only so big we can only make so many Investments and so do we invest more in resources for them to grow you know Talent resources and customer resources and marketing resources and um uh you know go to market resources and what what what's the right trade-offs at the right time the other thing is we have companies that are seed companies who also companies that we've invested in seven years ago that are like about to go public and so how do we serve companies along the whole spectrum and you know how do we um you know really be the best part of them throughout the life cycle so it's a game of trade-offs and uh we're constantly evolving and constantly trying to figure out how to get better nice man rooting for you guys uh thank you word for you too man I've really enjoyed this thanks uh who or what are best three resources these can be you know books people mentors or people you follow in the space we'd say Been instrumental to your success over these last few years I think you guys started back in 2013 right yeah I think back in 2013 exactly so I joined um a couple years in so yeah just so let's go through so a couple couple resources actually I gotta give a shout out to someone on another adventure firm I think Kyle poyer um of openview he has some of the best content on product LED growth uh he um you know we we've connected we both write a lot about product-led growth and we've compared notes uh we hopped on a zoom together for the first time a couple weeks ago he's awesome um he he's uh someone I really admire someone I really respect and in terms of content um you know I definitely give a shout out you know check check out um you know my newsletter which is a sub stack called notorious plg um every week we feature um you know new content and listen I'm a student of this I mean part of the what we do is we have a Founder guest right every week and so that he or she's talking about what they do and and so it's a great it's not me just pontificating it's actually advice from Real World people so every week you you know you you learn from someone um and then all this is the yeah this is the link here and and I'll and I'll say that um listen I think I'm very grateful to have mentors that weighing um you know Peter and Garo for the two Founders Peter was at itself for many years and guarded for that Sequoia for many years before starting wing and um it's really important to have mentors early in your career and and and and everyone's going to have different mentors you know but but you gotta you gotta put yourself out there you gotta you know to go ask to go out for lunch has to go for coffee and and just ask questions didn't learn so um hopefully that's a good summary check out Kyle's work uh check out check out my work to learn how some of these early stage startups are doing product life growth and and then find a mentor um you know at your firm or outside your firm absolutely yeah we'll add those links to the show notes haven't heard of either of those so I think that'd be great for people to check out um what does success mean to you today Zach whether that's personally Business Financial life is no right answer yeah interesting it was financial success um is What mattered in terms of success and as I've gotten older that that is probably like the fourth or fifth ranked thing um I think success right now is is is um you know listen is pushing myself to be the best the self-improvement is growth um and also the founders I work with I want my Founders to be the best version of themselves and so I constantly want to push them to stretch and to be out of their comfort zone and to and to help evaluate their their blind spots and so I I love challenges I love um you know discomfort I love uh growth and it's been listen it's been a hard two years for everyone uh with the pandemic and recession and it's just and so I think just constantly finding ways to worry less about what everyone else is doing and worry more about how I can get a little bit better every day um actually my favorite athlete is Tom Brady and he talks about that he just wants to be you know point one percent better every day and if you do that for 20 years you know you're really incredible when when uh when the dust settles and so that's what I strive to do and just kind of block out the noise and just keep pushing myself and that's that's where I get a lot of enjoyment out of and you know the much more so than financial success or you know any other type of kind of um you know more more material success measure yeah yeah absolutely I love it yeah we'll do the I mean follow the path of the the turtle not the rabbit who's kind of or the hair that you know goes different directions so I just give you know where you want to go and if you're sticking on your line you're feeling pretty good right exactly and and yeah so and so that's picking markets you like working with great people and and just keep learning and that's why doing this weekly sub stack has been super helpful because every week I learn something it's just I feel so lucky to um you know that that people uh that people help me help me work on it and I can feature great Founders in it yeah yeah absolutely um well
