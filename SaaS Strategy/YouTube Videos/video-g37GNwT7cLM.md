so today's call is going to be focused on cancellation flows and the best practices from the cancellation flows today we'll talk a little bit about cancel flow creation what we suggest there from a best practice perspective we'll go into offer creation and then uh we'll also talk about what the upcoming retention round taes will look like there's some exciting ones we have planned specifically my the one I'm really excited about we'll be talking about custom attributes in the future one and how to leverage those to make like really attractive cancellation confirmation offers that's just a little teaser but here we're just going to jump into it uh I did some some math some quick math before this call and I took uh all of our customers all the customers that are leveraging CH key today and looked at the average save rate so for customers utilizing cancel flows in ch key um the average save rate today is 21% now you might be thinking well we're we're at 14 15% we're at 15% um now a lot of this has to do with your customer base and who your Market is um but really if if customers if Cherokee customers are leveraging cancel flows uh we're seeing about an average of 21% save rate now this this is the people who go in and start a cancel flow and then either abandon it or um choose a Paul's offer or a discount or a hidden plan um so this is really taking into account every person that stays with your tool with your product and does not choose to cancel for the top 20 customers at Ching key and this is a pretty incredible number the save rate is closer to 40% now again this is specific to customer bases who you're working with uh and the market that you're in but that's a huge number that's a massive number and on the whole the average boosted revenue for the last month for every single customer in turn key was close to that 10K Mark that's somebody s that's a huge deal and that's life changing or you know business changing money there so we want to make sure that the best practices that we're sharing with you today are things that you can leverage to try and hit these numbers that I'm presenting today so we're glad you're here we're going to kind of move through this together I want to talk about right off the bat cancel flow creation before we get into the best practices just so that everybody's aware here when you sign in the CH key you have a primary retention flow in your in the platform ready to go for you it is what chy has kind of set up so that you have something there we encourage you to go in and update this because your primary retention flow is the catch all cancel flow and so before we move in and talk about segments and offers and different things like that that primary retention flow kind of serves as a North star before you segment and like think about all the different things you're going to be offering and different discounts you might be offering I would suggest going into the primary retention flow and updating it for your brand making sure your brand voice is heard in the primary retention flow because even if you're not leveraging it it is a good it might end up catching some of your customers later on down the road moving into our first cancel flow best practice this is something that I see with a lot of customers when I jump on calls um we're not leveraging an initial offer step and the reason why leveraging an initial offer step is important is because this helps our customers um psychologically think about different options other than canceling cancelling might not be the only option but for your customers if they're hitting that cancel button they might be thinking that's all I want to do is cancel they might not have a compelling reason to do so or might be looking for more options other than just cancelling but they're just thinking oh I need to cancel right now if you can offer them a pause at the initial offer or maybe a discount that might be compelling enough for them to stay this is going to change the way they're thinking about the cancel flow right off the bat um and typically this is going to help increase survey responses and give the customers thinking about why they're cancelling in the first place I like thinking about this um part of the cancel flow is as a can as a um pattern Interruption so you just think about the subscriptions that you have um as a consumer you know generally most of us are we we see the credit card state and then we think about how often we've used it and we make a gut level reaction right there uh that's very different for like you know very expensive purchases where we generally have multiple conversations but as an individual which a lot of us are serving um individuals and prosumers and you want to think about the initial offer as an opportunity to interrupt that kind of autonomous cancellation behavior that they're not really thinking they're just like oh I I don't need this anymore I'm gonna go cancel and that initial offer I think is it's really helpful to think about your customer and figure out what type of copy will kind of you know wake them up from that process and what type of offer can get them thinking about Alternatives because a lot of times they don't want to cancel they're just looking or once they see that offer then they'll start thinking oh wait maybe I don't want to cancel maybe I'll just need a little bit um maybe I need an extra month or you know maybe it's a discount whatever it could be but I think it's a good way to kind of frame that from a psychologist standpoint yeah yeah awesome thanks for thanks for both those answers I appreciate that um so moving around along you know right along into just kind of getting it more into the best practices of cancel flow creation so if you're familiar with chy at all after that initial step we're typically going to ask our customers why they're thinking about leaving um oftentimes I'll jump into customer calls and I'll take a look at these surveys and there will be 10 maybe even 12 to 15 options available for the customers I really want to encourage us to to limit the survey options haven't too many CH choices can overwhelm the customers and I mean if personally if I'm looking at a long list of survey options I'm just going to select one not even really think about the response at keeping the customer like ensuring the corresponding offer like you're going to be need to limit these options so that you can give a an appropriate offer on the back in So once a customer has selected a specific option being able to have a compelling offer on the other side is going to go hand inand with this so the free form feedback step we'll talk about that here in just a minute but that's where you can get granular into what the customer is really looking for but use the survey the cancellation survey and keep that fairly simple so the customer can read each option and select the one that is most appropriate for them I even encourage teams to add in the follow-up question on each of their uh each of the survey options this is really going to help you get granular and understand why customers are leaving and be able to get a sense for your customers on the whole so why your customers might be cancelling on the whole is much more important than an individual selecting other or something on those lines we'll talk about this a little bit more with other best practices as we go through this list we'll talk about it over and over here in the call the AB testing tool is going to help you figure out what survey options are going to be most helpful and most compelling for your customers to kind of think about once they're going through your cancel boils hey Daniel pause you there for a second Ethan good question in the chat here what is The Sweet Spot of options on the survey I know we have some pretty strong opinions on that so I yeah go ahead J no go ahead I typically suggest four to five um if you you know if you look at four to five options you're not overwhelming the customer with a ton of text you're keeping things pretty simple and generic they're able to read the whole list in one look like just by looking at the at the little window that pops up in their cancel flow that's typically what I suggest and then from the four or five you can even expand that out into follow-up questions once they have select one of one of the four or five but it's really going to help you be able to see Trends over time from the customers if you limit those options to a specific amount otherwise you're just going to get answers all over the place uh and you really just won't be able to effectively you know manage the product we yeah we recently did an audit with a with a large Prospect of ours and looked at their existing cancel flow and they literally had 18 different options there and as you started to peel them apart you could see that there was a lot of overlap and they had very low sort of response rate to each one of those and they didn't really inform them all that well so the cool thing I mean the way to think about limiting that if you have different you might have different customer segments that you serve you know some large customers some small customers but or even on different products you can actually segment your audiences as well so you can keep those those questions very relevant to who they are um Henry also asked should there should quote unquote other be one of those four or five bar you probably have a perspective on that it's a Hot Topic um I think my personal opinion on this is that other should not be one of those four five um but if you feel like you need it uh so let me back up if somebody selects other they are almost very hard to save and there's really not a good offer that pairs with that other topic um so we see save rates on the other response option being very very very low now if um if you're not quite sure what you need to include in those four or five questions and you want to include other our suggestion is you can do that but you really need to pair the feedback the free form feed back option with that specific survey even if you're not using it on the other ones you really need to do it on the other option and then what you can do is go through that feedback manually you actually need to go read like okay I'm going to go through maybe every two weeks I'm going to see everybody that selected other and I'm going to look at all the actual text that was written in so that ideally I can change that other to to maybe one or two options and get a feel for what those other options are um otherwise you if you just have other on there it's really not going to tell you much and um they're going to be really hard to save so um ideally it should be a temporary option that you're using to collect free form feedback that you can then kind of you know make an update and change it to something else down the road yeah and one thing about the primary retention flow that TurnKey has AA like once you kind of get started with TurnKey and turn on TurnKey other is one of the options in there and I typically tell te to remove that right away um but it is one of those things that could be effective for your annual customers or customers that are high value um so if you have a specific group of customers that might be around for a long time leaving other in there and really understanding why they're leaving the platform that might not be covered by your other survey options that could be really valuable for you so just keep that in mind as you're building out these cancel flows and we'll have a whole best practice I yeah I mean Henry thank you for asking that question I do have a whole slide devoted to other so um yeah we can probably just skip that one once we sit there Daniel it's a good opportunity to tease a new feature that we're working on which is we're really um focusing on improving the um the ability we're using AI in the background to categorize all the free form feedback and help basically turning it into almost like a chat option where you can ask questions and say what are the trends what are people citing with their cancellation and what are they typing in and then also being able to segment it by the survey option so we'll have much better tools to say okay based on everybody that has selected other as a um survey response what are the trends last 30 days what what are we what topics and keywords or um subjects are we seeing increase or decrease um so it's in development right now and I think that will then once we have that I think we might even come back and change our approach on this because if we have better automated insights into that then it makes a little more sense to have that included in the survey um so hopefully um some some new stuff it'll be coming soon some this current development spr exciting yeah and I think just along those lines I mean today we're looking at survey options as a you know a way you know a way to get to offering an appropriate offer to the customer who is looking to cancel um I think that there is a world where surveys can be much more in depth or much more you know granular to be able to inform your product moving forward so while we can do that today with the AI functionality within the analytic side of chury like we really want to get to a place where that's like informing what your product is doing so that you're building stuff that your building products that your customers really uh that are sticky for your customers um so we kind of talked about this a little bit um always enable the free form feedback it you can turn this on and just require five characters from your customers but really giving your customers the opportunity to provide feedback in the cancellation flow is really going to help inform your product moving forward and this is really probably the best way to understand who your customers are and what they're looking for from the product um that you're offering today um again we strongly recommend like making free this requireed you don't have to ask for 140 characters or a thousand characters you really can just say five characters and it's going to prompt the customer to respond in some way um so always enable this when you're R turning on your canc CL and we just talked about this Henry GG great question a little bit earlier um use the other cancel reason sping um as I mentioned I think that a good opportunity for leveraging the other is with your high value customers or customers that might have been with the product for a long time giving them the Forum or the opportunity to really lead their feedback is going to be really helpful here but otherwise you're going to see other kind of skew your results and you're not going to be able to provide an appropriate offer on the back end of an other response here's a great one that I see a lot of teams kind of um this is kind of a more ambiguous best practice but we really suggest leveraging neutral language in your survey responses or really in the whole cancel make it a positive experience don't make this a negative thing for your customers don't have them thinking about how your product might be too expensive or it's no longer needed right now give them opportunities to think about how your product has might maybe has helped them so or maybe the potential of coming back to your product in the future so for example instead of too expensive say something like doesn't fit my budget or no longer needed equals taking a break so it really gives them the opportunity you the opportunity to follow up with an offer on the other side it will really help your customer kind of see the value of oh yeah I will be just taking a break with a Pauls for the next two months something along those lines I'm kind of interested in this trend in general of um I'm starting to see customers offering different billing frequencies outside of just monthly annual um I think B2B has done this in the past with like kind of quarterly billing but um basically asking in the survey response was um there's an option of I need a different billing frequency or like you know I need a different pricing plan uh which allowed them to like really dive into that specific segment of cohort and that cohort of customers and you know present different pricing plans that's where that hidden plan U feature within Cherokee can be really helpful too where you can Pres present pricing plans that aren't on your marketing site and like almost use it as a way to kind of test new pricing options without feeling like you have to put it out into the wild and get feedback on it uh but that was I thought that was kind of an interesting approach um and something that was very actionable um for delivering new options yeah that one's great yeah I never would have thought of that you that's a great idea um awesome loving this this is fun um so moving into more best practices and this one's fairly simple giant walls of text and copy um Can Hurt save rates having your C you know requiring your customer to read a huge paragraph or multiple paragraphs um in between them pressing the cancel button and going through the cancel flow like they're kind of looking for a way just to kind of get through this and if we're not being compelling if we're not being compelling enough in the in the information we're giving them and being Sint they're just going to kind of ignore the information that we're giving them be Say saint clear be human with your copywriting and of course be on brand so this is another really simple one that you can do today it's just a little toggle um but set your survey questions to randomize if you have you know if you don't set it to R randomize you might find that the first option in the survey list is the option most often picked by your customers uh and that's just because your customers might just be clicking through um you know and if you set your to randomize this is going to give you a more clear view of what your customers uh are really feeling at the time of cancellations in regards to the survey um so this is one I added in here uh just right before the call made a little GIF about it but add your logo and set your Andor set your design to Dynamic we have a new we've updated our settings page in churn key so if you haven't seen that um what you can do is you can go in and add your logo across all of the communication channels that turn key offers so so if you're leveraging you know fail payment recovery reactivations Etc outside of the cancel clo it will update the logo across those items as well so you can go into the settings page and add in your logo there and it'll show up at the top of your cancel flow like you can see here with the basic theme and then Dynamic of course makes it look like that update your colors add in confetti do things to make your cancel flows as eye catchy and personable as possible any questions on that that's that's just a really simp and easy one to kind of update today last but certainly not least um always enable the cancellation confirmation Step at the top of this call I I kind of teased out that we're going to be working on one of these together and in a later retention Round Table um but really cancellation confirmation is that last final piece in potentially saving their customers or giving them a reason to come back in the future um we seen this be incredibly effective when leveraged the right way such as showing those in specific plans what they're going to be losing if they left that plan showing people with specific discounts what they would be losing if they left the plan today um and then also we've seen people bring in custom attributes that show the customer exactly how they've used their product in the past such as this podcast platform that saw a 6% increase in their save rate just by using this step to remind their customers the number of monthly active listeners they had I mean that's just so powerful at the cancellation confirmation step are you really do you really want to cancel here's the benefits youve received from our product since you've started so this is a really helpful part of it and we always want to suggest to turn on cancellation confirmation and be really thoughtful about the content you're presenting here I think fomo is the technical term here is that right fear missing out that's what we're really trying to go for here on the cancellation step yeah that's a good point um really just kind of showing like really showing giving that like overview of here's what you've used so far I think that you know we again I I'll bring it up again like the reason why that canva cancellation flow went viral was because it was so eye-catching showing you what you had done so far and you can really do that today in cancel flows from TurnKey just by leveraging custom attributes it's a very simple uh process to do and in a later retention Round Table we'll do that together so jumping in from like the setup best practices and creating the cancel flow we want to talk about crafting offers this is a little bit shorter of a section because your offers are kind of going to be you know a little bit more rigid but you can really test things out try things see what works using CH key one of the great benefits of CH key on the whole is the ability to test and try things out which out without having to commit a bunch of time and effort into coding and development and testing like this is a a really simple tool that you can update create your specific segments and get feedback on very quickly and make iterations as you get um that's one of the reasons why I join try it just made sense um so with the catching offers the goal is to find a sweep spot between preserving revenue and reducing churn so if you offered 100% discount your churn numbers are going to be very low but your Revenue number I mean your Revenue numbers are also going to be very low so we want to match maximize and find that sweet spot in between the two for your customer base so the way we want to think about this is we want to match a cancel reason given in that survey given in the cancellation survey to an appropriate offer so for example if you're choosing budgetary reasons as a reason for cancelling giving the customer a discount or as bar mentioned earlier a hidden plan something that they might not have seen before that could be really eye-catching on the offer side to keep them with your product and paying us like a discounted rate for the next month or two and then going back up to the normal paid amount lack of use really offer a pause here so I can't I think it was Henry or somebody on the on on the call already brought up um having traveling customers and giving them an option to extend their trial like these are kind of this is where the offers really make sense for the specific customer going through the cancellation flow so if they're citing lack of use or wasn't able to try it out different things like that give them that trial extension offer them A Pauls for two months give them a hidden plan that takes them down to a specific amount and lets them keep their credits if you're on a credit based system if your if your customer sit's missing features give it give them the opportunity to talk to support or give them a discount that keeps them around or compelled based on what they think they should be paying for their future set if they're experiencing technical issues really offer them a contact us op get get them in front of your product team really show them that they matter and that you can give them also a discount if you want to offer that so these are just some ideas just as far as matching offers with the cancellation reasons that customers come with during their surveys finally we want to think about discounts particularly here one thing that we've seen is kind of it needs to be pretty compelling to keep the customer around when you're thinking 30% off for 3 months is a pretty good minimum starting point now your customer basee might be different the way that you have things kind of model might be a little bit different but this is kind of what we see on average as being a pretty effective rate um and you can always again I I said this at the top of the call one way to really test this is by AB testing utilizing chy I know that a lot of people in this call have probably set up ab tests based on pauses and discounts different things like that that really is a way to kind of see which discounts which offers make the most impact in your customer based cancellation rate finally here's one thing to really keep in mind with paes um we typically suggest two months Max anything longer than two months you might be hitting some issues where customers forget that they were actually paulse and might dispute the charge later um picking the longest pulse period it you know you're giving up revenue for a long amount a longer amount of time and your customers might not even remember that they had uh an account in the first place um now there are some seasonal businesses that we you know we speak with on a regular basis such as construction businesses or things like that uh school you know different education um type accounts um but these are the exception so we would really want to encourage about a twomon pause being that limit for their pause duration um be mentioned this a little bit earlier but one of the really a really compelling offer type is to offer change plan or a hidden plan like he said you don't have to put a ton of effort into putting this on your marketing side or anything you just set this up in your billing provider and this is going to be something that you could apply on the offer side as far as the hidden plan goes so if you have a hidden low cost plan that allows customers to keep their credits or allows customers to still have access to anything they might have created but are unable to create more it's just a really low price plan these are good options for being able to save some revenue and also save that customer for a future date um no but I have seen paes be very effective and typically you know you're going to be able to keep that customer later and I mean for example I I have utilized paes in the past for you know job search tools or um different or like uh YouTube TV I believe offers A Pauls uh or they give me some sort of offering like that um so I've leveraged those in the past before outside of the CH offerings but I think that there the policy side of things is very effective um bear do you have like have you do you utilize polies uh on with your uh other businesses yeah we uh one of my um businesses I still own is called subtitles video editing and capturing software and the pauses are the single most helpful uh part of the cancellation flow and it's because we offer um usage based pricing I think this is really important to think through if you have any type of credit system or usage based metric or meters that you use to um Force pricing functions it pausing can be the best and one thing that works really well in conjunction with usage based pricing is um basically presenting how many credits or how how much usage the customer has left we see a lot of customers doing um basically uh rollover credits as well so if you missed a month and then they kind of Stack up within the the customer account and going back to your point around cancellation confirmation and fomo is when you present that and say Hey you actually have this amount of usage left if you cancel you're G to lose it all can be we when we see customers pair those things together it pause acceptance rates just Skyrocket works really well yeah awesome thank you bar well team um oh Rich got a comment um sorry D Danel he says pauses work great although some folks confuse that with outright cancelling sometimes yeah that's that's a good point it does happen um in your dashboard you'll be able to see specifically for pause acceptance rates what the reactivation rate is on those and generally we say as long as you're if you're over 60% reactivation rate on pauses that means you know it's a good fit for your customer base of you know there's always going to be a certain number of customers that kind of have that confusion and need to cancel so you're going to you might have some refunds that you have to deal with but if you're over 60% the math works out in your favor that you should be doing that if you're down in the 20 30% range of reactivation rate on pauses that means you're going to be probably dealing with more refunds and more cancellations um and maybe there needs to be something tweaked as far as the copy or the maybe the time um you know number of months that you that you offer pause wise but just kind of a good um you know good threshold to think about there followup question here too does churn key offer an option to send a reminder when the pause is about to expire we don't and that's because our um there's really no consensus with our customer basee on who on whether or not they want to do that or don't want to do it kind of seems to be that people fall into one camp or the other so we generally just recommend if you want to do that use your transactional email tool that you're using to send um you know account level updates and just have a have an email fired off on that on that trigger point good call there another question here too if you guys onl um can you explain reactivation rate versus save rate and what those numbers mean and I think reactivation rate is probably also different than pause rate and be maybe you take this one um and maybe how it relates to customers going through the cancel flow multiple times so that's sort of a two-part question that's it's a great question and um I don't have a perfect answer answer for it because I know our CTO has answered this multiple times and I should have a better I should have this memorized because there's a lot of edge cases that come into play like you said customers going through the cancellation flow multiple times they would only be attributed to the save rate once um in that case and so there's a lot of educations that go into that so I'll have a perfect answer but um that's something that we could definitely uh write up and include we'll do a follow-up email from this um and answer that really well it's a good question go ahead there so reactivation reactivation are those who the reactivation rate are those who come back and pay the save rate are those who start the cancel flow and either abandon it or choose uh pause or discount something on those lines the reactivation rate are those that come back and pay at least one invoice that number is counted to toward the boosted Revenue number that you see in chy today so if you think about the save rate that I've shared at the very top of the call 20% on average are going are starting a cancel flow and either abandoning it abandoning it or uh choosing a specific offer the reactivation number is that number of those people who have come back and paid after a given amount of time now there's a lot that goes into that number like if you are offering paes different things like that it's going to take time for those that are saved to ultimately ultimately come back and pay you an invoice um as far as those who abandon a cancel flow and then come back and cancel later um there is a cooling off period and just like Barrett said uh we'll have to ask ask um ask our CTO like what the measurement is for that I do know it is a a good amount of time so for example if a customer accidentally clicks outside the cancel flow and then immediately goes back and cancel that person is not counted towards your save rate because there's a cooling off period where the customer has to go through a specific you know action in your platform before being able to come back and cancel for that to actually count as a safe so I hope that kind of answers the question or gives a little bit more insight there but we definitely will follow up that's that's an excellent question and one that we want to make sure that we're clear on and I think that um I was just kind of poking around a few different accounts that come to mind um I think that 60% reactivation rate is another good like lower threshold that if you are above 60% on the reactivation rate so different from the save that indicates you've got a really good kind of fit cancellation flow fit to your customers um and you're you know you have some really good offers and if it's below that that's probably a good indicator that might want to just rethink um some of the strategy there great call out so in regards to trial extensions we kind of talked about this a little bit but if you are offering a free trial in some way shape or form it's really helpful to kind of segment your customers to be able to give them offers based on that trial so if you're talking you're asking your customers who are you know asking your potential or you know possible customers why you're looking to cancel after your trial really giving them the opportunity to extend that trial is going to be helpful typically 14 days is what we recommend but again this is where AB testing is really going to be helpful and understanding how long you need to make that initial trial so that your customers can see value in order to stay with your product so this is just one thing I like to really encourage to take a look at because those tring customers will hopefully turn into paying customers in the future then Pally segmentation we talked about this over and over early Turners so people who might have come in for a month you know paid a month after the trial or two months after the trial they might just not be hitting that value they need so offering them them a discount to kind of get them off the ground to kind of see value uh offer that to them so that you know and segment them particularly so that that you can try and get them the value so that they become longtime customers traving customers again offer that extension offer annual plan customers customers could receive an appropriate discount or a hidden plan based on their annual plan these are you know kind of thinking about the offer types that you're given is really going to help you you know across the board offer the right things to the right customers and they're really easy way to do that is by leveraging CH key to create multiple segments within those cancel flows so that your different customers your different cohorts and segments of customers are seeing the appropriate offers for them yeah I was sorry I was just going to chime in there with the when it comes to segmentation I always always got to find an examp a reason to talk about um psychology during the cancellation process because we think it's so important and if you don't segment your cancellation flow it's going to feel like a cancellation flow to customers right the consumers are now this is an expected behavior when you go to click the cancel button but when you segment it and you actually write the copy to focus on that specific segment of cohorts it it goes from a cancellation flow and it goes into more of a account management type conversation where the you know right when you say hey you're on an annual plan the customer all of a sudden again they're kind of T it's a pattern Interruption and now they're thinking like oh this is actually this is a more of a conversation and an opportunity to uh restructure my subscription versus okay let me just get through this cancellation flow so I think it's always good to kind of when you're kind of prepping your strategy for cancellation think about that get into the mind of those different cohorts of customers when you're segmenting and then write the copy to match up with that that's where we see save rates really really increasing uh and it's different for everybody so that's kind of the fun part to work through how what this means specifically to your customer base and not just you know always follow um you know just follow the general Playbook on cancel flows great call um I just want to say thank you for attending the retention Round Table um if you if you have some feedback or some questions and you want to shoot me an email my email is Danel churn key.co um please reach out if you have if you need anything thank you all for joining.
