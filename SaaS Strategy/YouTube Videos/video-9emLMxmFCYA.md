so if you have a SAS business that is a software as a service business and want to learn how to grow it without spending a single penny I'm going to show you step by step how you can grow and get more subscribers to your SAS business just by leveraging free Google traffic that's all done by the magic of SEO that stands for search engine optimization and in non- nerdy terms that's essentially the that's essentially the that's essentially the process of taking your site and ranking it up first on Google for multiple keywords people search for on Google so SAS for XYZ best tool for whatever right you will show up first for keywords that have high buying intent but more on that later on essentially I'm going to show you how to rank your site first on Google for a bunch of keywords people actually searching for for them actually want to buy your SAS so that being said let me just jump straight into my computer and show you exactly how you can get more traffic and more qualified traffic to your SAS platform for free leveraging search engines like Google so let's go by the way super short note I recorded a video a couple days ago that's 30 minutes long breaking down more steps on how this strategy works so go watch it as well it's again it's a complimentary video to the one you're watching right now and a while back I recorded one that basically goes over exactly my own SAS SEO strategy that makes around 2K day not more because this was like N9 months ago so again I'll link these two videos Down Below in the description they're super valuable and watching this one and this one will complement the one you're watching right now so these three videos should be like more than enough to get things going okay so let's go okay so your goal with a SAS business that is a software as a service business is to get as many subscribers in as possible people that pay you on a monthly recurring basis does making your Mr your monthly Revenue go up but again if you own assass business if you clicked on this video you already know what assass is and what the main goal is is to increase Mr and you do this by doing marketing now bunch of ways you can do marketing ads organic if out flyers on the street there's infinite things you can do that's the hard part about marketing now one of the good things about marketing is that there's multiple chances you can choose from the work and on this this you don't want to talk about uh organic in specific SEO like I said in the intro search engine optimization so it's a process of taking a site right someone searches for a keyword on Google right they search here right here for something and a bunch results appear right 1 2 3 four whatever right and your goal is to be ranking right here so you get the most clicks most people in most people introduce to your brand most people you can capture the email ret Target whatever right that buy from you now with SAS the single most effective way to rank first right is to do one thing and only one thing is to Target the right keywords no no super boring but trust me it's going to be worth it targeting the right keywords and these keywords should be of high buying intent I'm going to type that out high buying intent meaning right you got to look at the intent behind the search so when you're trying to rank for some keywords right let's say for example you do uh Tik Tok clipping tool or uh cap cut alternative or Zoom free alternative right or slack alternative or um tool to clip uh YouTube long form to short form whatever whatever it is that your tool does right uh you want to be ranking for these keywords have intent behind them so what does this mean someone searching for Tik Tok clipping tool of course they want to find a Tik Tok clipping tool but of course this is obvious but not always that obvious let me give you an example let's say for example for a different type of business let's say I have an iPhone repair shop right and people come into my shop but before of course they come into my website okay they come into my website and my website can be ranking for keywords like where to repair an iPhone or how much does it cost to repair an iPhone but it could also be ranking for keywords like um how to repair an iPhone right and let's say this keyword how has like 10,000 searches per month okay and the keywords where and how much all summed up get around 1,000 searches per month now you'd think okay yeah but let me just rank for this one 10K search a month they're more or less related right but the thing is that the buying intent behind someone searching for how is way way less than the intent of buying from someone searching for where how much right someone searching for where to repair an iPhone or how much does it cost toire iPhone they want to find someone to do it for them while someone searching for how most likely they want to do it themselves okay so the intent the buying intent behind these searches is very different and so the very first thing I got to do with RSU strategy is make a list of high buying intent keywords don't look at the traffic right look at the buying intent right and don't be demoralized when you see a bunch of your competitors getting a lot of traffic because then when you go go out and analyze which Pages they're getting traffic to and the keywords those pages are ranking four right you'll see that the keywords are super top of the funnel super like low low buying intent it's more like informational type of content like for example um how much or what's the max length of a Tik Tok video or Tik Tok video aspect ratio right again not that ranking for these keywords is invaluable but they're not only a lot more competitive but the buying intent is way way less now of course you could rank like a blog post for this right and you you could have like this amazing like log post with the title and the images and Venture Val info then of course down here like call to action Hey listen here's use use our um Tik Tok video AI editor right so you could convert somebody's traffic right somebody's toop of the funel traffic into nurturing them via email and eventually getting getting to try your tool for free right but that's just so much more work than just like targeting high buying int 10 keywords bottom of the funnel type content type keywords from the get-go okay and you'll notice that often times these keywords have lower search volumes meaning they're less competitive so it's just a no-brainer now after you Target and find your your high buying 10 keywords what you can do as well is you can just do like what I call a keyword Matrix where you just do in the y axis the buying intent and in the x- axis the traffic right traffic is usually higher traffic higher the competition right you make list of all your keywords right then place them here place them all throughout here where you think that they buying intent is and you can check the traffic as well using free tools right and then you do not Target keywords here and do not Target keywords here you go for keywords here and here in these two quadrants why because the buying intent here is high and here as well and here it's low buying intent low buying intent high traffic so this is not good I mean again ideally you rank first for all the keywords but if you're just starting out right go for this and this right because why would you like go to super competitive keywords that have low buying intent when you can go for keywords a year right low traffic meaning low competition high buying intent right and here as well so do this right um now after you have your keywords now of course now it's time to rank your site by those keywords and um I have a bunch of SEO courses and I'll leave them for free now the description but the key here and the specific note that SAS has is the types of pages you want to create so you want to create three types of pages comparison Pages alternative pages and information pages okay so what this is and you probably guess it because you're smart and you're watching this video right comparison pages are basically pages that rank for keywords like um let's let's say for example uh slack versus um or let's say Google meets versus slack okay boom and then you so your SAS versus competitor it's basically right and you build out all of these pages right and also by the way competitor one versus competitor 2 so what you do is you build all these pages right with in depth comp comparison between tool one and Tool two right again a page okay you can even do like an asset right here tool one okay versus to two I don't know make it look good because the that's another thing right UI and ux is super important right when you're building building a brand right you going to make things look slick look pretty because the perceived value goes a long way if people go to your site and it looks like well the perceived value is going to drop down and most likely people won't buy from you so the best example of this is apple right Apple just looks premium right and they are able to charge 10 the amount of Samsungs and Androids not because their phones aren't necessarily better but because the perceived value of their brand and this again a bit of a tangent meaning that you can have an inferior product in terms of features and support and whatever but you can price it higher you can make more money just by having a higher perceived value it's key I could record a video Sol on that but then again I don't have time for that right now it's for now it's about IO so yeah add like a making one you're making these comparison Pages L make it like an image a funny image then maybe maybe talk about what competitor one is right what they do how they work their pricing their features then same thing for competitor 2 what they do how they work their pricing their features then a table comparing features from one and two all the features comparison all the features again interactive things not just a boring big wall of text actually show them show them like in a better best way you can how these compare then again a wall text talking about features between both um pricing comparison between both so make the actual comparison then down below so again talk about comparator one talk about comparator two and then a comparison between both right and then of course down here Hey listen these two are good for XYZ but our tool is better for this give it a go free trial so what you're doing is you're leveraging these competitors one and two Brands their brand names because this blog post because it talks so much in depth about competitor one and competitor 2 about their pricing what they do how they work their features right eventually this is going to rank for their own brand names eventually this is going to rank for um pricing competitor one competitor one pricing so yes of course if you write slack pricing right of course slack is going to be number one but you'll see number two three and four will be slack competitors right writing blogs and pages about slack pricing with the little call to action saying Hey listen yeah you can pay stripe XYZ or slack XYZ but you can pay as the less for all these features so again what you're doing with this comparison pages is you're leveraging other people's Brands so what you do is again you build out comparison Pages comparing every single one of your competitors together so a versus B A versus C so compare make a list of all your competitors and then create Pages comparing them all together but proper actually properly done okay and you'll notice that again these Pages not only will rank uh for you're essentially stealing your competitors brand names and and questions people ask about competitors but the search volume for these keywords will be quite low so you'll easily rank on the first page and you can you then you can throw some backlinks at it if you want if you want you want to buy some backlinks just go to tr.com click on your dashboard and then just go here down here to to purchase backlinks these are Mega powerful we have a bunch of case studies on them I won't show them to you right now but if you go here purchase backlinks there's even a video of me explaining here how it works in a bunch of case studies but yeah again you can purchase back Lings for the Accra boost um and quick tangent by the way just know that notice that not excuse me that SEO isn't just about building content right there there's three main pillars to SEO there's on page SEO there's off page SEO okay and there's technical SEO on page SEO is essentially everything happens on the site so what you write how you write it the images you add the keywords you sprinkle in all the stuff that happens on the site off page essentially is link building the back links you build how many you build the anchor text the velocity all that stuff and technically is like the boring stuff side speed schem markup meta tags met descriptions U YX all this boring stuff again I'll leave a course Down Below in the description that talks about all this stuff so don't worry about it right now moving back to this again that's the very first type of page you want to create and these like will do wonders for you again they will rank quite easily for high buying intend keywords right because someone's searching for Google meets versus slack well they know what Google meets is they know what slack is and they know the paino they're in so they're actively in the market for finding a solution right so they're looking for what's the better solution so they're actively looking to buy something okay so that's that's the best type of people you can you can Target the the intent behind someone searching for this the intent behind the search has a buying intent that's through the roof right so that's why you want to Target these keywords and again leveraging your competitors brand names hopefully it's making sense right you're just this is just a mega strategy then alternative Pages well similar to this right but the the things that you're going to be targeting keywords that are alternative so for example slack alternative okay or competitor one your competitor alternative okay and so someone searching for your competitor's name alternative well they most likely Tri their competitor so they paid money for it and they didn't like it for some reason and they're actively looking for an alternative so this is insane the intent of the high the intent of buying here is through the roof again again just like in the comparison Pages the the the keywords alternative Pages rank for are for super high buying intent again look at what we said before super high buying intent is what you want to go for okay and then what you want to do of course is again talk about the competitor what they do what they don't do their features their pricing and again you don't do this just because you do this you talk about their their pricing their features their goods their don'ts their back prices because by talking about this stuff excuse me you make this article and this page relevant for all these keywords making it rank for a bunch of these keywords you making it rank for competitor one pricing or competitor one feature XYZ or does competitor one do XYZ so you're going to notice that all these pages are going to rank for a bunch of these competitor brand name related key keywords and but mostly of course for the alternative keyword again mega mega valuable make sure that this page looks great and then of course you'll cleverly introduce Your solution so they're looking for an alternative so you explain why your solution is a better alternative for them right here it's because maybe they're lacking in this feature maybe because our pricing is a bit too high for smbs right and then that's where you plug yourself in okay now little Quick Trick here you can also do your SAS alternative and you're might be asking why would I do pages alternative Pages for my own SAS well because you want to be ranking for this keyword you don't want your you don't want your competitors to be ranking for your sass name alternative right you want to be ranking for that keyword and so the go what you do with this is you the page you build out is you talk about your your assassin say Hey listen there's there's not actually a better alternative for for for this issue we are the best one that being said you can try this cheaper version but still has all these drawbacks hopefully it's making sense right again you want to the reason why you create a page targeting this keyword is because you actually want to rank for this keyword you you don't want to allow your competitors to do the same thing you're doing to them okay and then finally informational Pages well someone that does this amazingly is wise is wise I think you guys know what wise is wise is like a a digital bank right and what they do is they're they're a competitor of of like PayPal revolute and a bunch of all these digital Banks and what they do very well is they rank for um PayPal Search terms so a competitor theirs they rank above them so if we do for example PayPal fee calculator right well who's first wise or second right so the this is better than any info PayPal has on their site about their fees or whatever right that's why they rank first and this I could spend hours reviewing their SEO strategy but what what I mean here is that wise ranks first for a bunch of informational keywords from its own competitors so when people have questions about the tools they're actively using so let's say for example people are using using competitor one over yours so people a lot of people use competitor one okay not you competitor one I don't know how to right so a lot of people use competitor one it's the it's your main uh competition right and so because it's your main competition they have a lot of clients right they they have a lot of people searching for them right and so what you do is you build out Pages you can even look at their their docs so usually SAS businesses have like docs you can look at their docs and then use AI to write Pages detailing and answering questions bad than they do any actual docs of them their own right answering their own questions to their own customers and so by ranking above uh they're the SAS they're actually using for questions their customers are searching for their actual own SAS but the page ranking is the one from your SAS well you give you you you're creating the ability to Target these people right again just like why does I want to give you another example for example PayPal fee fees let's PayPal fees of course PayPal ranks first but this is awful right awful too too noisy a lot of stuff right ugly well who's ranking here and this will of course depend right wise boom there we go you can even actively interact with this actively choose the things instead of like this big wall of text and there ah this is so much sex so confusing so much so much stuff right what wise did was they took the info from from here repackage make it better and made this interactive calculator well this is this is so so good and I my IP is is set to Portugal so this could could rank differently in um different countries but again not just for this uh keyword there's a bunch more and they are stealing a lot of traffic from PayPal because they do this for a bunch of Keers and again your goal is to answer common questions people ask about your competitors in a better way whether that's how you put out the content maybe you put it like in a blog post with maybe a video a table of contents interactive stuff and again these will allow you to see a traffic and so this is the key to succeeding in SAS SAS SEO right SAS again stands for software as a service is a very specific type of business if you don't know what SAS is like Zoom uh iCloud Dropbox Netflix is a sass right this is software as a service a software people pay any on a monthly basis to get access to and if they stop paying they stop getting access okay and again the best way I found and that's what exactly what we're doing for our own SAS for in terms of SEO strategy to to do this because by default these pages when you're creating creating them and the keywords they rank for by default are high buy intent keywords again comparison Pages because it's one comparator one versus two and these inherently rank for a bunch of these related competitors keywords alternative Pages same thing informational page is the same thing now I know this was a bit of a theoretical tutorial but hopefully you got my point now if you want to learn more about all this stuff I'll leave links down below for free free tutorials a bit more actionable on how you can actually get started with this but I think with what I said right now you can trly get get it going if you want to use a which I think you should use AI because why not you can use chat GPT right for free or you can just use a tool like journalist which was one I show before which is a bunch of things uh to generate these articles you can generate the Articles you can uh even set it up like an auto blog so it automatically generates and posts the Articles to your site you can even have add a knowledge base where you can basically basically um upload info to journal about all your competitors so YouTube channels are theirs text documents audio documents um PDFs right and so now the AI is all of this content to be able to produce amazing content about your competitor so you don't even need to do the research the AI does the research based on knowledge you give it and then it produces these beautiful articles again you can place on these comparison Pages alternative pages and informational pages and I can almost assure you that if you do this because not a lot of people do this right because there's a bunch of sass niches uh and because these keywords tend to be very very little competitive because they get very little amounts of traffic they're easy to rank so you'll rank on the first page almost guaranteed and uh again they might get little traffic but the intent the buy intent here is insane hopefully this made sense if you want to give a go Journal you can use the code um I think it's Vasco just use the code Vasco and you get I think 10 or 15% off I think it's 15% off give it a go try it out if you like it let me know if you're not don't worries uh you can also always use chat gpts free version but it lacks a bunch of stuff there's no like um social media indication there's no oh this is pretty cool let me play a clip of what this says right now imagine this is a blog post on my Plumbing site about Plumbing right I can add in the middle of the in the middle of the article or even on my homepage if I want right this little uh widget right here this little tool right that in this case I made I made this custom and I'll show you how to make your custom for your business right that says um get instant quote right but first has tells me to plug in here a a a a prompt right it suggests to say my my toilet is clogged how much they charge for it so let's say for example my kitchen pipes broke how much does your company charge and so this is an interactive little tool clients or potential clients that come into your site can actually use right and then when they click get inst some quote and by the way you can customize all this it gives them a reply right thank you for reaching out regarding your broken pipes our plumbing company estimates a cost to fix it will isue range between $150 $400 depending on the exact and depending on the extent of the damage and necessary repairs please contact us for a more accurate assessment so in essence right this little tool you give the the client the potential client gives it an input clicks get instant quote and RI gives you a reply now you'll see here that there's this little box as well right here that prompts them yes as to sign up or to get more get more details right yes send me an email to get more details so you can have the client put in their email right here and you can change the but the name of the button to say um get quoto get in touch right the point of this is to make an interactive in make your traffic interact with your business and this is not only super different from anything else that's that everyone is else is doing out thereor but it creates this this this amazing feeling in the customer because they know what they're in for these tools give the user information right and again you can build tools for anything you want right so if I go here to magnets again create new magnet I can do a plastic surgery uh I can do calculators right I can do mortgage calculators I can do car financing calculators so like's say for example you have a um a car stand where you sell sell cars cars used cars right you have all the lisings for your cars and on the side you have like a calculator that people can introduce in their actually I'll show you this right I did this already right I did this for a car this is like a blog post about cars about Tesla should I buy Tesla is my first car and I added it down here a calculator um on uh uh getting free advice on ensuring my first Tesla so I put it here how many years my Tesla was driven my age and any past crashes and it gave me advice on it I can also do calculators for financing so how much money I have saved up how much money the car costs and what will be my monthly payment and like users that coming to your site looking at used cars can actually be even before even calling you know how much their car payment would be like and then you can even collect their emails and email them about car financing options so there's a lot you can do here and by the way the emails get collected and go here into the uh the leads tab so pretty cool you can apply this to SAS you can do like SAS pressing estimates SAS pressing calculators you can do like uh you can do a bunch of stuff with this I mean it's infinite things you can do so yeah that's it that's the video thank you so much for watching like subscribe check this out and check the description as well for more training and I'll catch you on the next one cheers.
