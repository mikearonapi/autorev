so I think that the main part is definitely the product like growth like the product selling itself that's where we get most of our users from besides that just having a free product that people love to use and having a passionate user base also creates a lot of word positive word of mouth and for us that's still really happens on Twitter for example where people actually go and share the tools that they use a bit more LinkedIn now as well YouTube and for us product being free you don't even need to create an account to try out so there's very little barriers to actually start using it and if you like it to also share it and that has helped us definitely a lot so the fact that it's free is a very big component uh in that we've also been building in public since the start and and sharing highs and lows bigger and smaller milestones and that has also been a part of our story we have been the boot strapped under dog and by building in public we give back a bit to the community we share our learnings but it's also a way of content marketing right because other startups are also our target audience so that definitely helps us as well besides that we have been working but we'll actually now really start focusing on AO and and growing our organic traffic to our website and actually now as well starting to look into influencer marketing to really spr give tally a bit more visibility but until now it really has been the product like growth combined with a lot of word of mouth and a building in public and that has been it for us.
