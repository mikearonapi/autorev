## Transcript

Hey, hey. I'm back with yet another episode of Creating Magic Inside the Product. And this time, we're going full-on Kumbaya because we're talking about communities. Yes. Now, if you've been here with me before, you know this already.

I'm a big believer in communities and like a put it on a t-shirt kind of a believer because a thriving community at this point is not just a nice to have. It's the glue, right? It's the Google Docs of shared growth as as an example. It's where you can share all your vulnerabilities and your es and flows and your flaws in your fonts. And it's like a psychological reassurance, right, that you're not here in this madness all by yourself. And I think that's really important as you're building or stringing anything together, including your life or your product.

Uh, imagine like the support you all are giving me here on LinkedIn as an example. Seriously, gold star emoji for all of you for being here. Thank you. Now, let's talk about SAS and communities. So when your users are deep in the product, yeah, fighting configuration dragons, figuring out those mysterious buttons or already ready to brag about their wins, you need to give them a place to turn to and that's where all this community infrastructure comes in as an example.

Right? So there are three main or core dimensions um to make sure that your community actually works on your product and the first one is plugging in the platform. So like a slack or a discord or a teams those are the usual suspects right? So give the users easy access to the moment they sign up and they can start collaborating with other people for more advanced use cases. So for example if you're doing ongoing events or for other B2C vibes you can check out might your circle but just remember choose a platform that matches your product's energy. You don't host quiet book clubs and discord as an example. Just saying.

Second one is building a knowledge library. So this is like your community's marketplace of wisdom. So this is where everything related to user generated content gets housed. So it could have your own generated templates. It could have workflows that you've created or your users have created and others can leverage and repurpose it, right? Um and then you don't need to answer the same question like 47 times.

People can actually just go to the knowledge repository and use it. So you need to make sure you tag it, you index it, you make it findable so that people are easily accessing these and also make it easy for them to generate content like tutorials and things like that. Like give them the tools to do that, right? There's lots of fantastic tools out there today that can help you create that vibrant knowledge library. Now, third is capture the feedback loop. Now, I've talked about this before.

It's like the users are living in your home. They're seeing all the magic. They're seeing all the madness of the product and you want to know what are those meltdowns. Yeah. What are those aha moments that they are having? And um you could run polls, you could do triggers, you could do like NPS's, surveys.

There's several tools like TY forms, hard jars of the world that can help you. Even Native Bronx can work here. Just don't be creepy about it, right? It's not surveillance. You're actually listening into them. And so that's that's where the magic comes in.

Now, social media is another big topic as far as communities is concerned. As you know, uh I don't have time to cover this today, but I want to dedicate a series or at least an episode uh to social media. So, that's coming up uh next week. Meanwhile, stay collaborative and most importantly, happy community building. All right, ciao.
