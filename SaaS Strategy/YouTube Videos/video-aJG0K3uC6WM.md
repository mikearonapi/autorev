## Transcript

all right so hi everyone this is Mohammad hammed Khan and today I'm back with another interesting podcast on SEO and today we are going to cover a very important topic a very important uh basically some strategies that are not I mean related to some semantic Su but mainly related to SAS Su and growth so uh that's why I've chosen a person who's like experienced in sasis and who's working in Industries in from 2019 and he has like worked with many companies mostly sasus companies some agencies as well some Ecom Brands as well and some local uh SEO projects as well and he's very good at SAS and uh I'm following him on LinkedIn and uh he's also from uh laor and uh lore in Pakistan and we both know each other and uh I just wanted to connect with him and discuss stuff over call and uh by the way I have basically Usman with me and U so I think Usman it's better to give your introduction yourself what you do uh what's your main experience with and how do you uh basically I mean based on your experience what do you think SEO is and uh overall up to you well first of all thank you so much for having me hammed uh it's a pleasure to be here um so I am an SEO strategist and organic growth strategist for SAS companies as of now I work with mainly SAS Brands to help build their organic growth Engine with search as a channel so in simple words that's what I do we help companies make more money uh through organic search uh in the past I've worked with all sorts of companies when I was starting my career started my journey I I guess a couple of years back um with SEO in my mind that was one thing that I wanted to be specialized in uh tested things around technical SEO link building content marketing almost all facets of SEO to just have a taste of everything and then um you know also got my hands into a lot of different vertical so for example at the start I was you know involved in e-commerce stuff local SEO and a lot of other things and then finally I transition to become more specialized in the SAS vertical so so yeah as of now that's what I'm doing I'm working with different agencies companies um either on an full-time basis so currently I'm serving here at triple do which is a s full funnel SAS marketing agency in the past I've been at flying cut marketing uh which is an SEO focused content marketing agency for SAS Brands um so both of these agencies specialize within the vertical of SAS that's their playground and um yeah I mean for now that's what I'm doing on the side I also try to work with companies who need some advisory help some Consulting help so yeah I'm just all about SAS SEO uh broadly speaking yeah amazing so I've also worked by the way on SAS uh like I've worked for a brand an email marketing company probably you know and we met with each other at basically a specific occasion and uh I can basically uh from my experience I can say that SAS is one of the challenging uh basically SEO I mean one of the like as compared to other for example Ecom local SEO or International brand for example SAS is one of the most difficult campaigns you actually create and lot of big Brands always there to compete with you so I can relate and uh by the way what do you think I mean for for a newb I mean who's just watching this podcast what do you think a SAS Su is and how it differs from the other uh types of website models yeah uh well before we jump into this just want to give the viewers an idea of how we connected so for everyone listening hammed and I were working uh in sister company so we had a common CEO and they were two different sze companies two different teams but we were um you know just working on those two different areas to different uh s companies they they belong to the same space I guess more or less right so email design and email marketing but for the most part we were not engaged on a daily basis we met once so but yeah um uh talking about SAS SEO I think the reason why it is different I would use a word different rather than difficult I think almost all of the verticals come with their own set of difficulties you would agree uh but specifically for SAS the reason why I think it's different compared to other verticals the main differences main differentiators that I would draw are one uh and I'm just trying to zoom out here right just painting with a broad brush so one would be um that there is a longer sales cycle involved right and the reason why that happens is simply because when it's a SAS company when it's a SAS product that is getting bought um the the offering is a software tool there would typically be more than one biot involved right so if you compare it with um let's say a simple you know e-commerce product like boxing gloves or maybe um you know U paint brushes or or tables or chairs the reason why buying a software product versus buying a normal accessory in the world different is because when you're buying a you know pair of shoes um you don't have five different people to consult to right you don't have to get a budget approved you don't have to talk about the you know trends of the company before making that decision so for e-commerce which which me what what that means is their overall sales cycle would be very small right they would the buyer will make a decision and then make the purchase in the case of SAS the sales cycle is long because um the buyer is going to talk to their executive sponsor and then they're going to talk to their CEO and then they're going to get the approval from the department head or whatever right so there's a lot of discussion involved for high ticket um software tools especially right the software tools that come with a higher ACV so that length of sales funnel typically means there's more opportunity to cover content the funnel broadens up um and that leaves us with more opportunity to cover top of the funnel content middle of the funnel content bottom of the it just expands into a broader customer journey to Target with Organic search content so that's one I would say the other thing is in my opinion uh that for SAS products by Nature intrinsically they need some level of educational content right so for example if you again think of any other sort of product in the world let's say um you know information products or maybe eCommerce products or something like that uh the level of education is required is lower if needed at all right so I don't need to know how to use a keyboard versus you know um a software tool so however if I'm you know buying a product like HDs I definitely need those videos created by on their YouTube channel the blogs that they written about how to use their product so that educational component is bigger uh than normal products normal verticals so I think these are the two main differentiates that one can paint definitely I mean you just cracked the answer in a very good way and uh it's like I mean these two things I mean from uh what I say is uh always I mean a a a person who's like looking to purchase a software goes through a long cycle he needs Education First then he needs more comparison as compared to buying a traditional I mean a very you can say an e-commerce product for example so again SAS also like deal with product but it there's a difference between product and that's why because they will be spend more cost and on a subscription model so it's always for example important for them to decide and take their time and have more options in the place and because if they choose a software they have to stick with it for at least for example some companies stick with like one year like the retention rate what we say so basically uh it totally depends on which SAS model you're working on but again uh the the basically decision stage they they make actually education I guess is very important and and when it comes to education the next thing is basically content marketing through which we educate the buyer basically so what what do you think I mean how the content marketing specifically is uh basically differentiated or unique or means than than the other types of like Brands like uh e-commerce brand because e-commerce brand do need I guess a lot of content to be produced they just put their category and product p and they get ranked even so but in SAS you have to produce lot of content and not just content but lot of education and connecting every stage of the sales funnel so what how do you approach this and what do you say yeah I think there's a really good definition that Kevin and dig came with which is U these two different views to look at companies or websites on the world one is and this is terminology coming from Kevin I haven't invented this um he said one would be websites that we can call uh integrators and then there are websites that we call aggregators right so aggregators would be sites like um G2 or for example Amazon or Walmart Etc who already have some information that they need for their buyer for the user anyway and then they use that information to also get indexed in Search and use that uh use that as a way to reach the buyer right through search as a medium so what that means is if with Amazon we need those products on the site anyway we're just getting them indexed and optimizing them for search and that's also um becoming content for us right so we but not necessarily creating content but turning something into content that we needed anyway on the site for the user right uh same goes for G2 or Capa Etc when you need reviews about software products um you would need those pages on the site anyway right you you have to have those content pieces is placed on the site um and the and part of their search strategy is to make sure that all of that content is already optimized for search and so that people can also uh find them through Google and as a result they can drive a lot of search traffic so those would be aggregators on the other hand I think there are integrators which Kevin referred to which are um companies that have to rely on a lot of in simple words manually created content so those would be companies like let's say um Shopify or maybe uh in our case for example you know mail Munch the company you worked at uner the company I worked at all of these different typical SAS companies that heavily rely on manually created content would be integrators right so you don't have a lot of Leverage in terms of content maybe you have in other shapes and forms but for the most part you don't have an asset that you can turn into an indexed form of search um to drive traffic um you know consistently on an automated kind of a model so I would say these are the two different types of sites that we normally deal with now I believe in the e-commerce space or maybe in other spaces in the world um other verticals there are more aggregators than integrators right however on the SAS side there are mostly uh integrators that we're dealing with right so when you when you hear the word assass project you know that you have to create a lot of landing pages you know that you have to create a lot of um blog posts in order to drive traffic your blog content your landing page content uh all of those assets are your means to drive traffic that is your content right on the other hand for e-commerce for example which is a totally different vertical of its own um you can use product inventory to turn that into index pages and use that as a way to create content right those product pages category Pages can be part of your content of course you would still create blog pages and all that stuff but uh just by getting your category pages indexed you still have a chance of driving traffic provided that they're well optimized so so I guess broadly speaking that's like the main difference um in terms of content marketing and then of course exactly as we you know spoke about the main differences from a broader scale if you think of a longer sales funnel that means you have more opportunity to cover the content marketing cycle right that means yeah I can create tons in terms of content um being in the bottom of the funnel Sphere for a SAS company how however if I'm thinking of the same bottom the funnel content for a e-commerce product low ticket item of daily use I wouldn't have that much opportunity so for example really simple uh simplified version of this would be if I'm working at clickup bottom of the funnel content can be comparison pages so clickup versus AA clickup versus TR um it can also be um you know X alternative blog posts so so different uh format of content right so x uh Asana Alternatives right those kind of pieces and then there's a whole vast wide world of transactional lisal blog post that you can create project management tools um project tracking tools right whatever so all of that would be technically bottom the funnel content however if I were producing um if I were trying to create content for a blow ticket item in an e-commerce vertical let's say keyboards the only bottom the funnel keyword or topic I can Target is uh the keyword model price in you know in Pakistan or in US Etc right perhaps that's what we would call bottom of the final content so the Spectrum in which you can create bot bottom of the funnel content for SAS companies versus other kind of products in the world um is broader on the SAS side compared with the verticals amazing yeah I would definitely agree by the way which type of content you prioritize first bottom of the funnel content top of the funnel or middle of the funnel or you plan everything together with divid them by their percentages so I normally and and specifically talking about SAS as a vertical here right um yeah try to plan this based on the objective that the company has and then I try to place this decision whether we need what level of funnel content um as a part of a bigger strategy for for any company so if they say hey this is our objective Usman this is what we're trying to achieve ideally they would come with a you know measurable goal what we call smart goal right so SM art um for those who don't know you they can check derivation but the idea is having a measurable goal that is attainable if they if they come with that and they have some level of specificity within their objective then we can decide based on a lot of other factors like the resources the competitive advantages they have the Search opportunity they have whether it would be beneficial to start with bottom of the funnel content or maybe reoptimize bottom of the funnel content which already is there on the site or for example create more middle and top of the funnel content so I would try to attach this normally with other factors such as objectives and what they're trying to achieve what kind of resources they have availability of I mean if they are like starting new as a software and like have big brands in place for example that they need to beat like you worked for active campaign I guess at flying kind marketing and you achieve their growth numbers if you can tell I mean to the audience what you achieved with active campaign by the way yeah so active campaign was a pretty fascinating project for me one of the biggest projects I worked on um not just because it was a unicorn tech company but also because of the vastness of the project so uh their objective was to grow in I guess four different markets so um in different regions so you know French Italian um I believe Portuguese um and Spanish right and German perhaps so four to five different languages um and we at fly cat assembled a whole big team of SEO Specialists and strategists for each of the region along with writers and editors and all of that stuff and I was the head of SEO on that project so I was you know working with a lot of uh people uh so I guess strategist strategy wise there were four to five different strategist for every single region every single Market um and the main Consolidated strategy and Direction was coming from me being in touch with the active campaigns SE manager um so in that case we drove you traffic growth I'm not sure about the exact numbers it's on my profile but um it was pretty good I believe in the in the span of eight to nine months and the entire case study by the way is on active campaign sorry flying cats website read the whole thing yeah so but yeah traffic wise and then um conversion wise customer wise uh ARR wise uh that was a solid project it went pretty well uh we draw a lot of additional traffic to the site and that was perhaps the main objective that they had with the project so yeah but that taught me a lot about just you know working with different teams and trying to um propagate a Consolidated strategy across teams um if I were to tie that back to your original question in this case would be in the case of active campaign example um I I believe that is a really good example here because they came with the objective of trying to grow um their customer base in different regions right and in their case we actually started very well with bottom the content so we planned a big list of landing pages that we want to create in different regions um and the strategists and the Specialists working on those uh markets specifically would decide how to position those topics how to for example you know um if one topic can also be created in other languages or do we need to do separate sege intent analysis all of that stuff would go into it but broadly speaking the idea was to create a lot of bottom of the funnel content which involved mainly landing pages so you know you can imagine for example they have email marketing as a product so you can say email marketing for different verticals email marketing software for different uh Industries right um and and that way they would be able to uh drive all of those visitors turning those into potential customers um the idea is that you know we have this process which I still am a big fan of having a deep dive call with the client at at the start which is typically like a two-hour call where we discuss everything about their product the potential customers what areas they're trying to grow in to and that's where we downloaded a lot of information from their team talking about the kind of Industries they want to acquire customers from so for example um I could be wrong but I believe they told us that e-commerce like other e-commerce Brands really use their product for a lot of good things and that is like one sector that they really want to sell to so that you know gave us a direction okay so if we create landing pages and blog content whatever mainly in the bottom of the funnel uh you know phase or or sphere um then content that relates to e-commerce buyers would be a bigger priority because that's the main customer base that they're trying to grow into across all of the region so again just trying with the objectives of the company uh what exactly is their growth team trying to achieve uh what kind of products uh sorry what kind of customers are they trying to acquire would give us a direction and then if if bottom of the funel content makes sense to them we'll pick that direction and then stick with it amazing so basically you started with bottom of the F content and then you expect did that to the top basically from bottom to top and by the way the experience with got working with active campaign and like we mentioned you achieve their organ growth numbers I mean that big some met some big kpis so what advice you give to a person who's basically starting the same I mean uh website I mean in SAS for example I mean uh what advice they should what you you should give and um and for example how many pages needs to be published and everything basically how do you decide everything for example creating a from scratch right um that that's a fantastic question as well as a loaded one so let me just try to be a little specific so we can you know really bring value to the listeners so would you say the company that is starting out now in this space um has a lot of resources or would you say they don't have a lot of budget and they're trying to you know compete with giants um so do they lot of for example story most of the websites exactly a startup don't have a lot of budget they have like for example just two or three writers inhouse writers and they just want to rank for example their email marketing product for this phrase for example email marketing they want to rank on the first page what would be the strategy from the scratch I mean in terms of content Marketing in terms of the bottom bottom of the F content and everything what you would recommend uh like in terms of the whole Su landscape like link building like on page Technical and even what are the stepbystep approach you would basic or give them as an advice to follow yeah I I believe my answer to this would have been different a couple of years back uh at this point if that is really the case which is one the conditions that we talked about right the industry is competitive so let's say the email marketing space we're talking about is a pretty mature C category right so there are pretty big players in the market active campaign and maybe mil chimp and you know other big companies of the world um the competition is going to be um pretty bad the second thing is we don't have a lot of resources we don't have you know big budgets as other companies uh within the sphere which means um you know we have to be very conscious of how we spend money and all of that stuff um so what I would say is in this case if that is really the case from an organic growth perspective right not specifically talking about SEO um I would in fact encourage companies or growth teams not start with SEO at all right or at least not make it as their main growth channel for the next couple of years uh until they have a pretty strong Foundation already created so what that means is I would try to promote the idea of jumping into uh other growth channels other channels that don't have a lot of competition um which are typically these days known as you know uh demand creation channels maybe it's a fancy term but uh you know what I mean right so just trying to create content where they can directly uh get in front of the potential buyer right because that's essentially what we're trying to do with SEO or any other channel we're trying to get in front of the uh potential buyers we're trying to get our content uh in the close proximity of the potential customer so if that is not possible with search because you operate in such a strong category and you don't have a lot of resources to start with um at least acknowledge the fact that there's going to be a lot of competition and it would be a good idea to for example the Founders or the small team that they have to start promoting the product on LinkedIn right start talking about the whole thing um and and try to connect with their potential prospects all of that stuff I believe that's what most of the companies in fact are doing really well uh we have great examples from companies like uh dream data or hocky stack or lavender right all of these amazing companies within the St space who are doing a phenomenal job driving Revenue not just brand awareness Revenue yeah so for SEO would be another one uh but but they're known for driving revenue on customers from other channels right uh these low intent channels that are non SEO um and and driving customers directly from them yeah so I would say you know start from there if we're talking realistically that they want to grow but then if we at one point establish that okay so we are at a pretty decent level and now jumping into search as a medium would make sense uh then of course there are a couple of things one uh they should definitely definitely um start with bottom of the funnel content right because you cannot afford the luxury of creating top of the funnel thought leadership content at this point you have to be very specific with what content are you creating and how it's going to contribute to the bottom line revenue metrics so it means if you only have the capacity to create a couple of pieces a month creating the content that is going to help the reader make make a puras decision right the content that is transactionally in nature should be the biggest priority right so for any s company that is starting out in a mature category I would say start with bottom of the funnel content um these comparison Pages uh all competive Focus landing pages or or uh blog posts targeting terms like competitor Alternatives those kind of things should be the biggest priority and then you start to move up in the funnel which is I believe a pretty standard way of creating content right it makes sense even from the Searchers perspective um if it think of the funnel of course you would want to attack the Searcher where they're ready to make a purchase and then you start moving up in the funnel where they don't have a lot of buyer intent um on the other hand another advice would be that they try to dive deeper into what competitive advantages they have right so and I would try to connect these threads with a couple of other factors which I look at normally when I'm trying to build an organic growth strategy um which is one the their product the second thing is their customers right broadly speaking perhaps the third one can also be a strategic narrative strategic narrative is something that I've been recently talking about on LinkedIn the idea is almost every other company is creating the same content as you right what is email marketing or email marketing software or you know these kind of terms anyone can extract from HF and start creating the content and there are tons of companies who would be attacking the same topics as you are so you have to have some level of competitor Advantage right content pieces that you are creating but no one else is uh having some level of unique differentiation in not just the topics that you pick but also the way that you create the content so what I would suggest is um that they do some Fierce level of customer research right so get in touch with your customer try to do a lot of customer interviews try to figure out what exactly differentiates US versus the other companies that we operate with in the same sphere uh and then also have a strong level of product knowledge right so product and customer knowledge when combined you can come up with a strategic narrative uh that is aligned with your company uh I have a example for this which I think will clear the view um in the light of the discussion that we're having so there were two companies in the same sphere at flying cat I actually wrote a post on this a couple of days back I believe so both of the two companies operated in the remote and online space right um so now the idea is normally speaking uh when you're creating content you would just create the typical you know what is something as best practices for something uh so in this case they were you know operating in the remote and online collaboration space meetings for example you would imagine you know we would be trying to create content on X video conferencing tools best practices for conducting meetings right all of that stuff and and it made sense for both of the two companies right so but what kind of differentiation can you draw that lies within the strategic narrative the Strategic narrative is supposed to be the company's philosophy about the problem that they're trying to solve and that would create a differentiator right between the two companies so for example we noticed that although there was a lot of overlap in the day-to-day aspects the features all of that stuff of the two companies um there was still a differentiation in their strategic narrative so the company one was all about how to conduct better meetings right uh so they would be like hey we want you to have better meetings more meetings um that you don't feel bored off all of that stuff right but but the idea is that we want you to have more meetings in your day right that's what they're trying to ACH communicate to the world through their Su content through their all sorts of content the other company although uh they had a similar kind of product they had a different strategic narrative and that narrative was um that we want you to cut down your meetings and have rather collaborative sessions right that was their position again they had very similar uh Fe to offer um with you know some level of Distinction but the position that they had about the problem that they were solving was that you shouldn't have meetings that are boring and stereotypical you should have collaborative sessions so this other company that I'm talking about had some extra features like wide boarding and a lot of other things that made the collaboration uh more engaging so in that case we knew that topics like for example how to avoid boarding meetings X tips to overcoming meeting fatigue in your company or how to set the right status meeting Cadence without overwhelming your team how to ruce unnecessary meetings at work all of those kind of topics would be a better idea to jump into because they're aligned with how their customers think how what kind of uh point of views they want to communicate to the world and those topics are also not getting attacked by other competitors because they don't um align with their strategic narrative right so it's a space that they found within the content marketing World um that no one else was tapping into so that was a competitive brge right so I would say just giving that as an example um that of course start with bottom of the funnel content try to prioritize purchase Centric content but at the same time try to find your competitive advantages within the content that you're trying to plan amazing man I love your explanation way and how you explain things um actually yeah definitely you you're basically uh saying again and again that start with the bottom of the of the Fel content and start your perspective like your brand identity your position in the market your why I mean you are like selling that service what the unique solution you providing if you focus on that one then connect everything from from the top of the funnel from the middle of the funnel to everything with your bottom of the funnel so I think you're saying that set some Foundation First on your website in terms of pages as well in terms of your mindset as well first and as well train your team on on that because ultimately the writer going to like create content and if they don't know what ultimately they have to sell and how how they would like make a bridge between someone searching and someone and with with their product with their solution for example their offering so I think this is this is a very important thing and I've seen people making the same problem and they don't know their USBS they don't know I mean what specific features they they need to more focus on or the more benefits they need to more focus on as compared to they talk generic so for example even for for machine perspective talking about generic things what everyone is also everyone is doing doesn't make you like rankable for example that's where the concept topical Authority comes in and uh by the way what are your views on topical Authority oh so um I I I think you know my position on this um I'm not sure if everything you you should clear it yeah for sure now I'm not sure if um if my position is very clear within the industry within the community because I talk a lot about it but I don't um I I don't think I've ever dissected My Views I've tried to clarified uh what I think so I think topal Authority is a real thing um you know if you create your content in a way that for example you know Kore talks a lot about this as you know right um if you create your content and you try to put yourself in an authority position within specific topics within specific areas of discussion within your industry uh then Google is going to benefit you um again connecting back to their um eat stuff you're just putting yourself as an expert as an experienced professional uh having a business of your own a company or an entity operating within that space um and that will eventually help you achieve better rankings um less friction in rankings helping you achieve more traffic than your competitors so I totally believe in that concept um however when it comes to the application of it right putting that whole idea that theory into use I think it sometimes is Impractical right so and I use the keyword here sometimes because I think for some vertical of course it might make sense um however based on the business model and based on the resources the objectives that a company is trying to achieve as a SAS company I don't think that whole stereotypical way of doing topical Authority or building that Authority um within a network of topics would work for most companies that's a idea that I have having some conversations with folks in the space so yeah I don't deny that it's it exists the concept makes sense it is in line with how search engines operate uh however its implications its actual applications on different scenarios is something that I tend to defer a little with by the way uh topical Authority is basically the topical you got around a specific subject with and connecting the entities contacting term together but definitely for every brand for every website uh having traffic is the is the need and I also agree with you having traffic is not always enough having the relevant traffic that ultimately pay your convert is the is the main thing so what about I mean I totally agree with you just focusing on the top of the funnel and covering everything even some pages you create just for the sake of ranking and they don't actually contribute into the business objectives the KPS you set in the start what about uh I mean for for the sake of ranking one page I mean from machine perspective you need to be a topical Authority around around a specific uh subject so every brand every website has its needs to rank on top so if you like specifically focus on bottom of the Fel pages but you are not focusing on I mean the other Pages that's I mean that set you as a topical Authority so is that you're saying that just focus on the pages that matter for your business or not focus on pages that are just for the sake of ranking so so let me clarify I think uh it's going to differ for different size of companies you know what stage they're at and all of that stuff however I think most of the application of topical Authority right in the way that you have to implement it um is something that wouldn't be making a lot of practical sense to companies in the way that they allocate resources so what that means is imagine the same example that we're discussing if there is a SAS company trying to jump into a very mature category where there's a lot of competition email marketing for example and they have uh limited budget limited resources um you know not a lot of brand recognition no one is searching for their brand at this point and they still have to get traffic from from search I would argue that they don't have the resources they don't have the money um to spend on the topical Authority content right so trying to create content which will facilitate the website to then become Authority and then rank their money pages right so in that sort of a scenario as I mentioned I I might in fact be tilted not towards search engine at the start in fact towards more on other demand creation sort of channels however if search is at one point a a good channel to invest in I would be more inclined in other ways to rank a page um and attain traffic rather than trying to create you know hundreds of pages to create a semantic content Network right simply because it would be impractical for them and that is not just an assumption of mine but also something that I've encountered in some of the Consulting conversations that I've had so for example there was this HR tech company I was talking to them on growth mentor and um they their first question to me was okay we've talked to a couple of SEO folks and they say um we have to create these 200 Pages for tropical Authority um around these specific Concepts or topics however our customers are not searching for this right they are suggesting this because they think within the HR Tech space within the human resources sphere we would have to create this content in order to present ourselves as an authority to Google uh and it makes sense however we know that almost 90% % of the content is going to bring in unqualified traffic because our customers are not searching for these kind of material these kind of topics so so I would just say just from a resources perspective when we're trying to create a lot of content just for the sake of bringing more author authority to the site that luxury might be there for bigger companies right who have a lot of budget who can invest very aggressively in content but for smaller companies who need to be very conscious of the decisions that they making them of content creation I would think it lacks practicality on the other hand is this other um ICP discussion that I just talked about which is if you're creating a lot of content for search engines to then perceive you as a topical Authority and then help your many pages to rank uh wouldn't that bring in a lot of traffic that is not qualified for your business so all of that traffic gained is only for the search engines to push you higher in search um of course you will still rank some of your important pages but at what cost right so that whole balance to me looks a little off actually uh what is the alternative you think that you you you have basically instead of topical Authority for example you're saying that if you need to rank on a specific phrase like email marketing you don't need to cover everything connecting with email marketing back to email marketing for example the attributes it has the context it had for example and further that drive attributes and other type of things I mean You' saying that instead of focusing the most important definitions or concept related to email marketing you just focus on the concepts that are related to your business I mean what is the strategy for that I mean do you think that uh just for email marketing there are like 20 PES that are relevant with your Source context if you just create those for a machine basically I mean machine is ultimately the dictator who will just like uh pass your content then it will it will show up to the user and then they will come and convert so machine is the main barrier or the main you can say dictator or the ruler basically so for machine perspective don't you think that a machine basically uh has has some authoritative sources in place for each knowledge domain like for health there's health line for in for for for example Finance there's Investopedia Google or machine is always uh prioritizing that website Mo on most of the queries on most of the keywords in simple words and ranking them again and again in simply it simply means they don't like want to spend Budget on the new site and the focusing on the one they have already trusted and using that website as a source for satisfying the need of its user like the user who use Google actually so topic Authority basically for me is what I think is a concept of like creating a Content Network to help Google and understand your uh your basically whole purpose I mean the whole whole context you have covered around a specific entity and has helping them reducing their cost while giving more meanings and relevant information within a particular subject and definitely I'm not saying that you actually forget about your Source context your business model you connect everything back to your Source context is this is uh this is also possible while having a topical Authority as well and connecting the whole uh topical cover with your Source context like like your business model so don't you think that this way we can make topical Authority practical as as as well as beneficial for the business yeah so I I think the the point here is my position is I'm not saying Top Authority is not going to work or it does not connect back to the you know the source context as you said right the the money driving topics or the or the content I'm not saying it's not going to connect back to it um the the problem is it's just not binary right so we're not saying topical Authority works or not works we're saying on a spectrum how well it works compared to other a Alternatives that we have so you talked about alternative approaches um the way I look at search is um that I want to be a marketer right a Content marketer or a growth strategist and then I use search as a way to distribute my content I want to bring iols using search as a medium so if if tomorrow search is gone I want to be still a marketer who now develop an understanding of some other platforms to distribute that content right so now when we talk about alternative approaches I would say my position is that there's not a single way to Wi win within SEO as a distribution channel so of course topical Authority will will make sense it might drive value it will work because we're trying to you know at the end of the day partially trying to please Google in order to put us in front of the users and then we can convert them however there would be alternative approaches that would still work in my opinion even better so for example one is the same thing that we disc discussed a few minutes back which is trying to find your Competitive Edge so again if you're in a category which is very mature email marketing for example or you talked about for example Healthline or Investopedia right these kind of sites that are um considered Authority by Google me as a small fintech company or a health tech company trying to compete with Healthline or Investopedia I'm not trying to rank for the same phrases as them right that's my whole point so me as a small business would say hey these are you know this 5% of content is all I really want to create because this is how I'm going to drive Revenue this is the content that is actually going to fuel me growth from organic searge now the problem is how do I rank for this without creating all of the additional content that those sites have already created and dominated right so in that way I would try to think of maybe two different approaches one is um hey as an alternative and I'm not saying this is an alternative maybe there is a lot of overlap however um as a second um way to look at it as a different angle can I feel growth through links can I do digital PR can I do a lot of other things uh that will help me fuel that growth help me fuel that Authority right um in in the eyes of Google from authoritative sources and it's still going to cost me money but it will also um add with referral traffic for example from other you know related mediums right so if I'm an inbound marketing sort of a platform within the SAS phas if I'm getting a link from HubSpot from a super related topic which I know is also going to drive a lot of traffic off off its own I would rather do that than trying to create 200 art articles on different topics to build my topical Authority right simply because to me it's a value equation what input are we putting in in terms of resources the cost it's going to incur to the business to create that content versus the value that we're attaining out of it so if I think hey this one back link or maybe these uh you know this one digital PR campaign is not only going to fuel us more domain Authority right strength for backlink profile but also is going to result in referral traffic that is super relevant right because right after sear traffic the biggest source is typically referral traffic which can also impact directly contribute in customer growth I would rather do that right in my opinion for some of the cases especially in companies uh in Industries where companies are dealing with a lot of giants um email marketing is an example right we talked about this so so that is like one alternative way to look at it I'm not saying you can always replace topical Authority with back links I'm just saying um in some cases you might be like hey can I build five more links or can I do I have to create this other S anticon network in order to rank these money Pages higher uh and I've seen tons of companies doing this uh Gano dinard for example from previously at nextiva and Aura is a really good example of this approach um he would create a phenomenal kind of a piece of content and then rely on backlinks um to fuel growth and again strategically plac back links I'm not saying you know the um fluffy stuff I'm actually talking about stuff that not only drives you more links from Authority sit but also referral traffic that is qualified so that by by default needs to be uh qualitative work on the other hand just giving more examples of um different levels one can pull right as I mentioned I don't think there's a single way to with SEO I remember back in 2021 when I joined flying cat there was a customer within the vacation rental space so we worked with a lot of vacation rental companies um and that company was a B2B consulting firm uh and they used to work with vacation inal companies right now within their case they had almost zero content on their side they were um competing with giants like logi or you know other big companies um and still rather than creating tons of pieces of content to fuel topical Authority I remember and this was not even a conscious decision against topical Authority or semantic SEO this was just an organic search strategy that we made and decided would work best for the company we noticed that their CEO is very well known within the space right and and he has earned a lot of brand mentions and uh on the web so he's mention on different sites and all that stuff uh we assume that it's going to help us from an authority standpoint and then secondly we also noticed that on their site they had a lot of podcast content like hundreds of episodes um with just a single page for each of the episode right none of that content was transcribed and by the way this was the pre-chat gbd era right so transcription wasn't really a thing there were only one or two software tools out there who would do this for you so our strategy was to turn all of those episodes into blog post by just transcribing them and having an Editor to look at them right so that in my opinion was a phenomenal way to look at it we we gave them that that idea I'm not sure if they executed because you know we just the project ended but that whole idea of its own made sense to me because if we were to create those 500 pieces of content it might not make sense but hey if we have this other Lev tole they have a lot of podcast content can we transcribe this can we turn this into textual content somehow put some editorial help on it and then optimize it for search um and then I guess as we talked about some of the other cases of just trying to find your Competitive Edge as I mentioned if I'm in a mature category I wouldn't want to rank for what is email marketing I would want to rank for of course email marketing software sure but even if that is super competitive I can find opportunity in super longtail keywords or or super specific keywords that align with my strategic narrative still drive Revenue uh without even trying to you know build this topical Authority at all um and super B example of this would be the approach that Brandon Hufford uses right so Brandon Hufford is the you know in the previous uh roles he worked at active campaign and has been director of SEO at multiple agencies and now currently he works with SAS companies to advise them on their growth uh and his strategy is this famous strategy of 3s which is talking to your sales support and uh customer success team right and trying to drive insights from them and then turning those into topics now none of that in olves keyword research none of that involves creating a semantic content network but still if you just create content on those kind of queries um that are directly drived from those teams that are facing the customer um you would find enough search volume to still bring traffic bring customers without having to compete with the competitors right without having to go into this U rout where you have to utilize toopal Authority so I'm not saying topical Authority is not going to work or if it's a bad idea my position is if in some cases we see that there are better alternatives to still drive the same level of Revenue with less number of um resources less budget then I would rather do that amazing amazing so basically you are not against a topical Authority you mean topical Authority don't need to be work in every for example landscape Revenue any business model or any kind of your objective it totally based on your objectives whether you want to utilize topical Authority you can use other alter Alternatives as well so but there's there's one concept I would like to add here I mean if there's a subject for example again email marketing this is a good example by the way and uh I mean starting from the user perspective I mean someone from from the very awareness state from the attention awareness the whole Sal fin stage I mean from Google point of view there's lot of queries path sequential queries I mean the first query then you research then the other query then the other query I mean the if topical Authority is aiming to connecting all the search sessions or the search queries that someone is searching around a particular subject don't you think if you cover all of those queries their sequence in the same way on your website and connect everything together like how user is searching the behavior of users basically around a specific outcome which is email marketing don't you think Google will choose you as a source that this website is not is just not for focusing on a specific type of attribute with what what this website sells or offer as a service but also focusing on solving the problem I mean you are talking the same I guess what I'm talking by connecting all the search behaviors of the of the user for Let me Give an example for example email marketing is an outcome and the different verbs of uh different behaviors associated with associated with it for example starting with for example uh explore learn uh for example no compare and for example buy or basically uh rent anything I mean these all verbs basically these are search behaviors that are connected with email marketing which is an outcome so what about connecting all these behaviors together in a connected manner on your website as a Content Network and help Google and both users by offering as a good source of whole content Network and solving problem uh so this always Google uh for for Google this this always could become a priority or as as a Preferred Choice as compared to solving multiple behaviors through multiple websites CH versus choose one website who has covered all the behaviors of the users in one place this ultimately will save cost for the machine to to just call and uh and interpret and understand one website versus many other websites just for the sake of getting different behaviors around one outcome so this is uh I mean this is my narrative by the way uh and again backlinks are not bad but what I'm sorry what I'm uh what I'm actually zoing backlinks are actually dying day by day I mean I've seen some sites I mean uh if if your content is shitty for example if they're not like solving the whole uh I mean backlinks are not in that case will not work so this is where I mean it's not about creating helpful content for the users it's about creating uh you can say cost effective or you can say easy to understand or easy to interpret content for the machines first then again helpful content is very necessary I'm not saying you don't create helpful content so again it's like about uh minimizing the need of backlinks with the help of creating more structured content Network so I guess this is what I think and I believe you also agree with me well I I have a slightly different point of view so I so I I believe I I posted this on again a couple of weeks back um my point is I I believe a website that is 100% search optimized right uh a website that is loved by search engines would never be 100% user Centric right so exactly as we talked about this um if I'm creating a Content uh if I'm creating a Content Network and turning my website into a entity a network of entities connected together for Google to reduce its cost of crawling and understanding the content right um and giv me a lot of information retrieval score all of that stuff um of course Google is going to love me but at the same time that means I've invested a lot of effort into uh attracting audience that I don't think is going to be relevant so for example um and then perhaps disconnects with another fcet which is I don't believe a lot of companies have a really good idea of their customers so um again if we are in the email automation space let's say right or email marketing space almost every company would think of the same um yeah maybe this is something that we can do in fact uh pick five you know email marketing software companies and ask them hey if you were to create bottom of the funnel content uh or top of the funnel content what would those be um give me five topics for each they will give you content ideas with 90% overlap right so everyone is going to take talk about the same thing however if you talk about the customer profile if you ask hey who are you targeting you know what are the pain point that you're solving um what what are your U point of views about the problem that you're solving within your sphere those would have massive differences right so despite having different customer profiles different pain points that they're trying to solve still all of them are creating the same exactly same looking content it just doesn't make a lot of sense so in the same way what I would say is if someone just talks to their customers really try to understand them not just get on a call and ask them a bunch bunch of temperated questions but really try to grill down their needs they would understand that maybe their customer is not searching for what is email marketing right maybe they are searching for something el else but HF is never going to give you that data you never know what those searches are and then as a result you're never going to create that content right because it just doesn't look fancy enough to create content on something that HF chose to be zero search volume keyword or topic so again my point would be uh if we are creating our website content in a way that search engines love us uh there's no way at least in my opinion that we can uh attract 100% qualified traffic there would be either if we had a lot of budget and we created all of the topical Authority content all of the centic content anyway um then in that case a lot of unqualified traffic is or irrelevant traffic not even qualified is going to come in from the uh from the search and that is happening with companies like companies when they talk with uh some Su agencies and they recommended to create a lot of content for the sake of topical Authority um that involves a lot of irrelevant content so for example and I've actually tried to look into this just to uh be able to change my mind if that is not the case I looked into some of thetic content SEO case studies um and I found some of the content to be like totally different than what the buyer would be looking for right and I understand again because we're trying to optimize for the machine first the engine first so that it can benefit us and then help us attract the same audience that we want but the cost of doing that right the the expense that it's coming at um is just so much higher that for me it doesn't make sense to go into that route so some of the semantic case studies I've noticed have a lot of definition Focus content um however if I were creating a SAS content strategy um I would never even think of creating velocity type content for the first few years until we've exhausted all opportunities right so and and another point is hammed um I think search in my opinion isn't the one and only way to drive traffic right and that is something that I'm trying to expand my mind into uh now just trying to embracing myself um trying to embrace myself as an organic growth strategist rather than just an SEO growth strategist right so I'm thinking if truly to drive organic growth uh maybe it's not too bad to think of other channels where you can still get the same level of traffic and attention uh with less level of effort um and then of course you can still you know turn that content into search indexed optimized kind of content so you know this this these are the two terms that I use I say um you should not be creating search only content you should be creating search friendly content which means you decide what level of content and what type of content you want to create and then you say hey okay how can I make sure that these six different distribution platforms give me the traffic that I want so for example um if I am creating versus pages right clickup versus Asana clickup versus Trello all of these different kind of comparison pages on my site um I can say I've created that content it it exists on the site um I just want traffic now uh well let's optimize it for search let's make sure that it's you know keyword focused and all of the best practices are followed there are a lot of internal links coming to the site the anchor Tex is optimize let's build some backlinks so that search gives us traffic but at the same time we can run ads we can promote that on LinkedIn we can send it to the you know um maybe through email uh in fact our sales team can use it when some of the potential customers ask about hey hey clickup how do you compare with Trello how do you compare with other products the sales team can simply pick that URL and send it to the Prospect and help them convert so the same piece of content is just getting distributed in multiple multiple ways um with the objective of driving organic growth so I would just say uh to me the way I've seen most semantic content networks to be created um it it doesn't feel very customer Centric right it doesn't feel like um it's very focused on the needs of the customers um I don't think a lot of companies in fact understand how differentiated their content should be based on the minute differences that they have with other customer other companies customer profiles uh one company's targeting director of marketing other compan is targeting marketing Specialists still they're creating the same content just doesn't make sense that you're targeting two different personas two very different personas a marketing specialist is not going to search for advanced level stuff similarly a marketing director is not going to talk about what is SEO so why would you create the same content um and then lastly this other thing that we talked about which is just um understanding you know good resource allocation good making good business decisions and then trying to think of search as just one of the distribution channels not you know the the only dist distribution channel available to you yeah I would agree with you uh man basically I mean I've also seen people I mean doing same kind of mistake I mean forgetting about their business model forgetting about why they need to show up in the stff for forting about their bad identity just just focusing on I mean helping Google I mean with all like information yeah that's fine I mean Google is this is what we Google want from a website to get as much as information context to serve it user in a better way by spending less cost so for example uh I've seen by the way people who are doing same kind of mistakes I mean they just focusing on the top level very attributes The prominent attributes even they're not relevant so I would say even some of the clients I've worked with I've created their topical Maps I have just based on their budget obviously I've suggested only the pages that are relevant with your business relevant with their business model not the whole like there could be like 2,000 Pages even so you you cannot create those kind of pages just to satisfy the machine's need yes you understand that but you can achieve that same level uh topical Authority with just two 200 Pages as well or like 100 Pages as well so I mean the idea is same uh what we are discussing on to to get that traffic that has some interest in your uh in your in your in your service or solution but not every one for example if a topic is like what is email marketing not everyone going to convert only one or 2% or just 05% uh people going to maybe convert or looking for some softwares for example so in that case you you cannot say that you will not cover a topic like what is email marketing you have to cover that because it will drive user further to the bottom of the F pages and again topical author is also the same thing like connecting the whole idea of of users through their multiple stages into one place which is your content Network so I would say uh you can make it perfect if you want right right right well I I guess we're on the same page I think the the bottom line here is the Crux of this whole thing is if if you're starting with your customer first if you know that for example hey my customer is actually searching for what is email marketing right I know my customer and they're actually looking for this information and of course at the same time it's also going to help Google reduce their cost and you know put me into a topical Authority position then of course starts a win-win we're friends right uh but if there's a mismatch uh then and your only motivation is for SE engines that's where I think some of my beef starts uh one question that I have for you in fact uh is I've heard around semantic SEO and by the way for those who don't know a couple of years back I was a lot of a lot into it I was just you know reading patents a lot of other things and then I actually got myself out over the so it's not that I'm not a fan of it uh it's just that I I've just moved to a different direction now uh but I have different or contary views about these things but anyway um I still think its application is there for some of the verticals um and of course you folks are doing amazing work so the question that I have is um I've heard that if you're trying to create semantically connected content you know leveraging entities and their connections and trying to create a cemented content Network the actual fation process would require you to write content in a way that is facts focused rather than opinion based so is that true actually we focus on both I mean the eat factors coming from I mean Google quality dator guidelines even I've read a Blog by the way written by S sheer like he worked as a quality dator for some time for Google I mean you do not just focus on the facts obviously yes you focus on Declaration the fact first but after that because the first I mean if you like for example answer answering a question uh for example you declare that answer in a very consensus way like what how everyone does and after that you give your opinion as well to set yourself I mean as an as an expert for example you use first first person pronouns like us we I like that so I mean uh we both we focus on facts as well from machine perspective as well I mean machine has like because you have to classify yourself with the top authority sour you have to discuss the fact you have to discuss what is obvious okay and after that you give your opinion I mean to make things very uh I mean uh based on the conditions for example if you saying how much water should you drink a day you're answering like okay for man for men basically you should drink for example six or eight glass per for example or liter per day and for wom you should drink this way and now based on your uh you can say opinion now you can say okay if you're for based on the condition certain type of medical condition as well you can make your context more consolidate or sharp the context and you can also give your opinion in any way you want and you can expand the basically context based on your opinion so that's what always Google love as well because you're using you are giving your opinion as well Google like uh connect everything with your expertise eat as as your uh like authorship basically you created on your website so uh that Al always help you basically so first we do declaration then we do opinion based so basically if we do opinion first basically we want rank because everyone on ranking on Google has some sort of not opinion but uh exact definitive answer so this is how we approach this right right right that makes sense I think uh there was a post by Ryan law who was talking about how it's hard to um you know give a unique point of view and also make your cont always search optimized and it it was more of a point of view from him what he thinks is true he was saying that you know search content needs some level of consensus and if you're just creating content that is super opinion based uh you might not do super well so and and his approach was to go into the Information Gain drout which is add some something that is unique something extra um and then interesting interestingly the folks from grw and convert which is this content agency um you know the the two co-founders who are very well known in the content sphere within the search landscape they created a video on YouTube trying to address that and in fact showed multiple examples where they rank multiple Pages for competitive terms on opinion driven content even if it's related to health for example which is you know a space that Google is super conscious about um so it it looks like um we can still Rank and also you know um like you can still rank even if your content is not 100% facts-based And you have some level of Ops uh sprinkled on top of it so yeah it was just interesting just knowing it because I've heard a lot of contradictory advice on this yeah amazing I can uh you connect your search objective with your business objective that's the key here so I I've basically gone the same problems and I've seen like on a daily basis this is I been the failure of today I mean most of people still focus on suchar objectives and that this is why we are like doing this conversation to uh to make to make some bridge between I mean search objective there's a lot of difference I mean not every query someone searching basically is basically you you you can't connect everything with your business context so I would say this is uh this was really important and uh when it comes to Let's coming back to SAS again uh when it comes to SAS I mean what are the like top KPS do you think uh someone who's working in the start for example maybe you can uh divide the KPS based on the quarter wise if you like prefer to work on quarter wise for example first three months you should focus on these kpis then the for the next three months what are the like main kpis you think that assess business should set in the first place yeah so I think the actual kpis in your working on organic search as a growth medium is normally the same for most of the companies right so we're talking about the same metrics however the angle with which you're looking at them and tracking them and then making decisions is a little different and and there's a particular framework that I use in decision- making um which I try to stick with and propagate in in my communication with the clients or you know uh leadership which is uh what I call this rankings to revenue framework which is um if you're starting fresh um you know because a lot of folks say hey Revenue uh is all that matters rankings are vanity metrics traffic is Vanity metric well of course everything is Vanity U but if you don't have anything to show you have to rely on those as indicators of success that's exactly what a kpi means right we're not saying driving rankings for specific keywords is Success because at the end of the day you need traffic and revenue however those are indicators in the future you're going to get the value that you're trying to get so I would say start with very simple rankings uh especially I'm just assuming that it's a website that has no content and they just starting very fresh right so of course it's going to look super different for mature companies who are driving a lot of traffic already but if it's a uh fresh website with no content and they're just starting to publish I would say um start with monitoring how your search Impressions and flies are jumping up and ranking for some of the core topics some of the core keywords that you really care about uh and then use them as indicators of whether your current strategy is moving in the right direction or not because at the start you would not have some customer acquisition numbers to look at um as you progress forward of course you would have more data on traffic and engagement metrics so you can look at those um engagement metrics I'm always a little skeptical about because you know in the way that most of these tools track them so you know for example in the past bounce rate was always quoted hey this bounce rate is high and I was always pushing back it doesn't make a lot of sense uh if it's for example a definition page what is something uh of course the bounce rate is gonna be high because that's the goal we want someone to come on the page and then read it and then go away we don't want them to buy that that's not what they're in for so but yeah uh some of those engagement metrics if just looked objectively and you can connect the dots um on an advanced level of course you can use uh heat map tools a lot of the stuff to look at um some fancy stuff but at the start you can keep it simple some G4 metrics would be good just looking at you know average time on page it's kind of overall engagement specific metrics would be good apart from traffic clicks and Impressions uh and then as you progress forward um in a few months I would say just looking at the uh customer Centric metrics that relate to business grows would be the Super crucial ones right the most crucial ones so at the end of the day if in a few months you're not at a place where you can see leads coming in um and then tools converting into customers um and driving Revenue then that's a problem now of course that whole period can look different for everybody but not saying in two months you can drive customers and that's one of the mindset shifts needed within the SE sphere but broadly speaking um if you're starting with rankings and then thinking of traffic and engagement metrics and then jumping onto Revenue Focus metrics which is you know how many leads how many conversions and then on an advanced level once you've once you passed that stage and you have created this very well- running um very well oiled machine of content engine uh and you're driving traffic on a monthly basis I would say you can jump into metrics um that are more fancy such as the pipeline velocity or how fast the deals move from one stage especially in the B2B cycle right uh where for example there would be a speed first it becomes an opportunity then you know mql SQL whatever and then finally it becomes a customer so throughout all of those stages what is the time period difference between uh the leads coming in if it's getting reduced um compared to other channels or compared to the in the past when there was no marketing involved then that's a really big indicator that you're reducing friction from the buying Cycles so um so that's one you can look at the conversion rates across the funnel so you can say you know what percentage of traffic is becoming a lead and then what percentage is moving from one stage of the funnel to another one um so basically the conversion rates from traffic to mqls mql to sqls and then you know moving forward until you attain a paying customer those conversion rates would be fancy to or or maybe in fact useful um when you reach a certain stage um and then I would say the the framework that I was talking about right these are all of the metrics that everyone has access to everyone can see these metrics in their sech console their H their HubSpot CRM whatever they're using but the framework that I would suggest is uh to use this rankings to revenue which is uh if at one point you see that traffic is Flowing properly you're not seeing any inconsistencies there's no unstability rank revenue is there customer acquisition is cool even if there is a some level of traffic drop of course try to look into you know what happened but don't be concerned about it in the same way um I would not be like if we move on to the other stage the past stage which is traffic I would not be concerned about how bad the ranking movements look like how volatile the rankings are uh if the traffic is still there right so for example if there's a page we lost ranking on the primary keyword but we at the same time gained mod rankings for other adjacent longtail keywords for the same page and the traffic is uh sustained I don't care about the primary keyword rankings R right so I would in fact stop looking at it I would just look at rankings as an indicator of potential traffic I get I can get in the future and then traffic has a potential indicator of getting revenue and customers in the future so so that's the framework the angle that I use which is I don't care if traffic is down if the revenue and customers are fine as long as it's not too bad or it's not saying something that we need to pay attention to for example maybe there's a Code update or something then of course you need to pay attention but in general uh I wouldn't be super obsessed with volatility and traffic and revenue if sorry traffic and rankings if the revenue and customer Centric metrics are fine so that's just one way to look at it yeah by the way I really loved your approach rankings to revenue so basically I me you start with ranking objective as as as as a maybe based on your objective like the first quarter or the second quarter and also uh I also like used to work on a model like for the for the maybe first quarter you don't like have if any historical that or any for example ranking or any kind of conversion or sales revenue for example you start with uh outputs as an kpi like you start with okay for this month we have to publish this number of Pages this number of stuff you have to do and X XYZ so you maybe you can set uh the output basically one is output the other that comes after the output is outcome so instead of focusing on outcome in the first quarter you f you maybe first focus on the output that will drive the outcome at the end of the day so output could be like number of pages you're going to publish number of maybe internal LS you going to for example do uh number of for example brand mention number of listing or for example schema markup anything thing that could contribute in the long run um in terms of getting the outcome desired outcome and yes you you need to set outcome as well like the coming six months these are the outcome we need to meet but for those outcome these are the output we need to set so I I think this good balance you also need to carry with your with yourself so by the way uh which tools uh I mean you mentioned G4 you mentioned H sport CRM by the way which other tools you use and uh just maybe not just for tracking uh the kpis but other whole Suite you use yeah yeah well before we jump into that just wanted to say this addition that you made at the end which is super I totally love this input and output uh division um I think I was just looking at it from a success measurement standpoint however um I think there's a superb article on this by Tom Kito which is you know um an amazing person when it comes to building executive presence and Leadership skills and just connecting with the audience sorry the leadership um as an i executive uh he has a brilliant course so but yeah he he wrote this amazing article on input and output metrics and how you can justify your effort to your leadership to your clients um and that was shedding the light on exactly this input output uh model right so of course you have those other metrics that you want to track rankings traffic Revenue whatever but at the same time at the start when you don't have anything to show you have to rely on these output metrics and make those your goals those many goals uh I think it's especially good when you have a very well netted strategy um and that strategy then connects back with these tactics so finally if you say hey we have to publish six pieces a month because this is how it attaches with the final goal this is how it's going to help us achieve what we're trying to achieve uh then of course publishing six of those pages every single month with without any problem is going to be a Min achievement of its own so I totally love that and I'm totally on the same page about those input output metrics when it comes to the tools um it's pretty standard I'm not into a lot of fancy stuff um so for example we would try to track uh primary keyword rankings through H Str tracker or any other sort of position tracking tool um Google search console is pretty standard one I believe for any SEO in the world um apart from that um I would jump into of course the CRM so the HubSpot or you know whatever CRM they're using to look at different metrics um however when it comes to blending the data together to make the decisions um I tend to use Google data studio uh and that is something I've tried to adopt more of ever since gf4 came out simply because I don't like the you know usability or the overall interface of the product yeah so so gf4 um is not super uh easy to use for me and that yeah and that resulted in me trying to adopt Google data studio and trying to build our own dashboards So currently uh even at triple do that's what we do we have our own dashboards um and yeah we just try to blend the data uh the good thing is at triple we have Team support from marketing analytics department so for bigger projects we're trying to blend a lot of amazing data which means in a sing sle uh dashboard I'm able to see the traffic rankings um and then at the same time customer acquisition data mixed up with rankings and and search traffic um coming from the CRM so we can just pull data from multiple sources and blend it all together to make uh consolidated decisions and when it comes to content planning I mean do you use any specific tool I mean for topic research I mean you mentioned you use you can use HF but just for getting help not relying on HF or everything you focus I mean you mentioned I mean uh HF a good tool but for Content planning uh what other tools you use by the way yeah so one uh I guess super grossly underrated tool in my opinion is Google Autos suggest in itself so that's where I typically tend to start so if I for example and by the way um I don't tend to start with keyword research or topic research directly uh for me doing the customer research and building that whole understanding is a task in itself which takes a lot of time sorry how do you do customer research I mean what is there any tool like spark T you use like I mean any kind of tool you use for customer research or you do everything like manually by read Maybe by uh listening to the calls of sales or support team or reading through the for example uh chats of the other conversation I mean how do you do customer research before keyword research yeah well spark door would be an amazing tool to use for sure it's a amazing audience intelligence tool um um I haven't used it a lot for our own clients um however just you know as you mentioned this I think a couple of weeks back there was um this coach series at triple do where we invited a couple of guests to speak about specific topics and one person who's the content SEO lead at HubSpot rori um SP SP about connecting social signals uh social setting with SEO and that's where he actually like that presentation was phenomenal he talked about sparo and a lot of other stuff where you could see what people are searching on and at the same time who are those people that are searching for those things so yeah but anyway uh coming back to the topic for me as of now I don't use sporo I don't use a lot of fancy tools uh when it comes to customer research it is pretty manual for me so what I tend to do is um we have mult mulle calls with the team of the company so it can be the product team the customer team customer facing teams so sales support um or maybe customer success um or maybe in some cases even the founder right uh if they have some customer recordings so sales recordings or for example if they can help us set up some customer interviews so interviewing some of their best customers and asking them questions we take a lot of notes uh I have a template that I use uh some of the Frameworks I've created on my own is just you know downloading all of that information because believe me customer research is one of the most complicated skills someone can ask I'm still learning I don't have anything uh I don't consider myself an expert in this um Ryan Paul Gibson who I've recently had on my podcast is an expert in this um however you know just asking the right questions and trying to download all of the information that you really need to build n suu strategy is a skill in itself I've created some of the templates that we use um to you know receive that information and then blend it all together to turn that into a Content strategy so for example uh at triple do in fact just two weeks back I've created this sop um which is super thorough uh that mentions exactly how you receive that information how you make the clients give you all that you know all that you need how you ask the right questions to the customers um how you position yourself in a way that you're um getting everything that you really need to build that strategy and then you blend it all together to create a mirror board so again there's a template that I've created uh in which you can visualize the customer Journey so you can think um so it's like a the customer Journey if I'm you know the map that I'm talking about on Meo if I can just give you a description description idea it's like a um mixture of the jobs to be done framework so on the top you have you know some ideas around the customer profile um related to jobs to be done framework right um the related jobs the core job the desired outcomes of the related and the core jobs um and then on the other hand the bottom part is the entire customer Journey so what we try to ask to the customers or to the customer facing teams is hey at different stages of the buying process what kind of concerns or or things um the customer is concerned about or interested in or you know um the customer related to so for example if you know we're talking about the first stage of the customer Journey we would ask hey what are some of the triggers that would make someone uh think that this is a problem that I need to solve if if you stick with email marketing as an example for example right we can say um if I am a person who would need an email marketing software at one point I would face that problem right at one point I would be like hey this I have this problem to send bulk email um emails to my customers to whoever I want to send those emails to um how do I solve this problem so there would be a trigger for sure maybe I looked at a metric uh that made me think hey this is something that you need to solve your email marketing um is not driving enough traffic you know something like that maybe the open rates are not so good maybe your cost cost of email marketing department is higher than the other departments so what are those triggers what are those metrics right so that would make the foundation for the first phase of the customer Journey how which would be like top top of the top of the funnel right and then you dissect all of that into normally an average of five to seven different customer conversion um phases right so it is typically um you know this top of the funnel area that we talked about and then somewhere in the middle when they're evaluating Solutions and then somewhere in the um in the bottom where they're making decisions of what brands to buy from so a typical you know uh stage four to five stages of the customers being unaware problem aware solution aware then being brand aware so but yeah the second part of the mirror board is like that where we have the customer Journey entirely visualized and all of those key points um that relate to those different customer conversion um points uh mentioned within that whole journey within that whole map um so yeah that is a map that we finally create and then finally we turn that into a Content strategy again there are a lot of nties that I'm trying to miss here uh simply because I cannot be as thorough as that but yeah that that is one pro priority framework that I tend to use across all of my clients before creating a Content plan amazing I think we we could set up another podcast on doing customer research basically it's a long as you mentioned it's a very one of the challenging part I mean especially for SAS I mean I'm I'm assuming why don't you start your own SAS brand we have a lot of SBS knowledge and I'm not sure do it in future oh so I actually have something in the pipeline um it's not a super big SAS product I've talked about this already um so it was related to programmatic SEO at one point I simply couldn't find the time to still work on it um simply because you know at the time I was switching my Dru and a lot of other things were going on I in fact had to stop my podcast a couple of weeks or months back so yeah it's just a matter of time that I'm not able to find currently and the mental bandwidth I believe to work on it but it's not a massive SAS company that I'm going to start or something it's just a mini tool that anyone can use U more of a side gig so I just created it because I was experiencing this pain at flying C when I was trying to build their programmatic SEO process and I couldn't find a solution like that so I just thought maybe building something of my own could be a cool thing but it's still you know I I've used it on a couple of projects uh it's not something that I've you know shared with the audience openly so maybe in the next couple of weeks months I can try to you launch it or put it out in the public but yeah nothing planned as of now very concretely so you're basically more inclined towards working with uh agencies right instead of focusing on yeah yeah I mean I mean I I don't mind working with uh companies as a solo or not solo maybe as an in-house Su strategist I've had those offers to you know join join them as a in-house person just being in charge of their SEO program as a whole but I just like variety so for me you know the thrill of working in an agency where you can gain a lot of experience all the time uh again again being specialized in a vertical so it's all SAS but still you get to experience you know um massive brands at the same time super um small startups were very Scrappy so you get to experience all of it you get to taste a lot so yeah so I would like as I said on the side I do some advisory work some Consulting work working with product companies directly but uh for my full-time gig I'm always inclined towards getting variety nice nice I hope it will go good and U and like let's conclude this because the time is like adding and I would say uh I wanted to make it crisp and I I know a lot of uh information that is still pending on my mind lot of knowledge points that I need to put but um just sticking to the I mean SAS but SAS is like not a like shortterm deal it's like long-term game and uh by the way Brands like milch hops sport there and Salesforce there I mean when you're trying to compete with them you you you see The Nightmares by the way uh like the effort you you deal with like for example training your writers for example and even uh SAS writers mostly I mean I mean in terms of Education they they have to research a lot and not everyone can write basically SAS content so basically I'm trying to figure out or maybe build some system as well to train writers on a specific product and I would love to discuss maybe in the future like how do you do deal with writers and how do you train them for example and and how do you train them basically not on SEO uh SEO Channel SE objectives search objectives but also uh train on the product or business objectives as well so I would be happy to chat with you as well uh but like last question I would maybe try to add here uh you have an expert uh growth marketer what whatever you say I mean uh I mean do what tips like you you would like to give to the uh people I mean not just L to SAS maybe but overall you can make it like generic like common problem you've seen people making you can maybe uh pinpoint those problems or you can explain them further how to maybe uh overcome those problems or challenges so so you mean addressing sass companies on what problems they should avoid or do you mean career advice for other folks who are starting an SEO uh people who are working with uh Brands and doing their strategy Su campaigns what advice you would like to give yes as career as well if you would like to like how to start Su how to uh how to master the career but definitely people who are working uh in companies and they are not getting the results in terms of search objectives for example or any objective what mistakes you you you you seeing like they are making and how they can overcome that for example this could be maybe the good right mold mold this question mold this question according to uh according to yourself whatever you feel better sure sure I I think we can touch upon both angles very quickly so and I believe it will be perhaps the same advice uh that can be picked on either of the two angles so one is pure Crea Vice how can one progress in their career if they're an SEO strategist or they're trying to become an SEO strategist and they're earlier in their career journey and the other part is um how can those strategists or Specialists working on organic search as a channel um drive drive meaningful results so I think it's always going to be in you know again connected back to everything that that we touched upon finding your unique competitive advantages so and that you can only do if you dive into your customer profiles your product understanding if you build those knowledge hubs in your mind right if you have a super idea of what my product does who am I trying to reach uh if you can talk to them if you can build that comprehensive understanding of what your customers go through on a daily basis um what your product does how it's different than a competition all of that stuff with the outcomes that your customers are trying to achieve using your product and then on top of it you lay your SEO knowledge I think you'll be at a benefit uh you'll be basically just killing it um right as of now the only problem that I see most of the SAS companies making is they're just doing the same thing like almost everyone is targeting the same keywords building the same backlinks there's no innovation at all and I'm not you know I'm not saying there should be Innovation just for the sake of it but there is a dire need for that right no one can win if everyone is just doing the same thing if you're a SAS company and you operate in a niche where there are other players in the market and you're doing nothing different in terms terms of your content strategy in terms of the decisions that you're making what content to create how to create it U the integrities of what to put in an article all of that stuff if you have no differentiation compared to the competition I guess you deserve to lose I don't think you you deserve a spot in the Top 10 rankings right um so I would say just try to find your competitive advantages um and that will always be backed up by solid research on the customer and the product side uh on the other hand I would say for the career advice the same thing if you can develop as a skill right where you're still an SEO right you don't have to think of yourself as a marketing jist you can still be an SEO but you have some core marketing fundamentals will will worst in your soul right it's ingrained in your fiber to be a good marketer and then you have SEO skills uh to put your content into search rankings so learn all of the technical things for sure JavaScript SEO structure data right learn all of that but make sure that you're building upon the foundation of being a good marketer you know what icps are you know um you know how to conduct customer research up to some level you don't have to be an expert it's a totally different skill set of its own but just knowing in general that you are a marketer and all of the fundamentals of marketing applies to your channel as well will put you in a better spot that is in fact the main problem that most marketing teams have in terms of their gap of communication and Gap app of understanding when they're talking to their SEO Specialists or SEO teams right um which is the seos don't speak the language of Executives so if you can speak the language of Executives by you know thinking as a marketer right so and when when when I say think like a marketer I'm not just saying you know uh try to create an ICB profile on a Google talk I'm saying build all of those Concepts in your mind that make a good marketer which means you know how to communicate to the leadership you know how to present um presentations you know how to talk about SEO in a non- jargon fashion right um how to connect with your reader your leadership everyone that you work with on your team and trying to create something together that is not just helpful for the search engine but also for the user but while also making it super simplified right so yeah I would just say be a good marketer uh find your competitive advantages and then lay out your SEO knowledge Su skills on top of it and you'll be fine yeah the first one I I mentioned you someone working in a specific uh company as an agency as as a as a marketing specialist and using Su as a channel for growth uh need to differentiate with with a top compor so I think this this is a million dollar advice I would I would uh take it as and someone who's like listening to this and the other one carer one as well like focus on the foundation first and uh and master one I mean instead of Jack of all I do not prefer I mean for some I mean it's it's good but uh if you like thinking Master one and then uh build build that specific discipline like you said python is your JavaScript SEO or even SP or even SAS SEO build make that one and master that one and uh and make that discipline as your synonym for example if someone uh talking about that thing always you should come to into their mind so I I guess brand yourself on that but but first learn people started branding theirself first and they don't even get get the foundation and that's where they mostly fail and again case studies are important I mean they need to build some case studies first and the case studies always come with hard work with some passion with some failures with some bad experience so I would say this is a go thing and uh one thing I would like to add here very important thing I mean most of theud haven't uh seen them like working very closely with the content team they just assign topics and they just build a road map but they don't even check the writers even if they're sticking to the guideline I mean for me especially it was a gamechanging for me like I used to work with writers even I have to write the content myself sometime to show them okay this is the prefer version instead of like okay this is this is good this is bad instead of like the boss attitude you have to be later I mean you write I mean sometimes for even one definition we have have to write five or four four to five variations and I also involve myself as as a Content team and then we finalize something together and uh I mean you need to work as a into micro micro level things as well just to understand the process from very scratch if you're like doing very good proper research customer research but your writers or even the ultimate thing who going to convert or going to rank or going to uh ultimately give benefit is the content so you need to very uh closely work with the content team as well and uh some skills uh some I mean also I would say courses are not enough like people watch I mean get the courses for like for from the HP course and they think that now they're content marketer for example it's not like that even write for writers as well you have to you have to go through the process multiple time you have to fail and then you master the process so this is actually my advice instead of working in your Zone work work with cross team as well like marketing team needs to work with the uh sales team as well challenges yeah I would also add um just you know learning and then also being open to relearn right uh just opening your mind to saying um maybe whatever I've learned so far I I can still learn more and at the same time I can challenge my own Concepts that I've developed so far so always be open to just learning more experiment test things out uh see how things goes um and just not let your current knowledge um take away the possibility of gaining more in the future yeah good one good one okay I guess that's it uh it was a very nice conversation by the way do you I think you like red color because every time I see you you're wearing red oh yeah the case I I don't have an ination towards the color I just for some reason have a couple of t-shirts and they all look the same uh some of those are they all are red by the way yeah I haven't made that intentional decision but it is the case for some reason maybe it just happened unconsciously um the shades are different but I guess in video calls they just look the same so yeah amazing amazing and on the ending note I mean I will hand over to you uh but before I would make something very clear I mean first of all I'm uh the content you're producing on LinkedIn I mean it's very for everyone I mean watching this I would recommend go to the's profile I will pin uh uh basically pin the profile or add the profile in the description his LinkedIn profile is literally gold mine I mean the tips his I mean uh I mean producing on LinkedIn you can't find anywhere and coming from his own experience not reading the top blog and rephrasing the information or maybe through chat gbt is creating his own content and the podcast is producing you should also uh cover and by the way uh I also started YouTube channel and uh you know what I've I've got more subscriber than you so I I know I know it's not healthy competition now we have yeah you're you're way ahead of me man uh there there's definitely no competition you've transcended that approach you're a SAS you're a SAS uh chah by the way um I'm by the way I will come back to SAS some after some years by the way it's not something that I forgot I it's like in my blood sass I'll come back to it later uh and but just focusing on some more you can say it fancy but for me it's uh very gamechanging and it's delivering and maybe in the future after like probably six months or one year I can maybe come come up with a case study through topical Authority and hopefully working on that my old portfolio websites client's website as well so I hope there will be some good okay so coming back to the point uh this conversation I mean it's like very good thing I mean very good start maybe we can continue this series coming with a smart as well and uh with more as mentioned more guests coming on my podcast and I'm trying to cover not just semantic Su but the whole coverage I mean like the growth strategies the growth marketing methodologies someone needs to adopt so I guess this is what I think and man do you want to say something on your behalf well thank you so much for having me Hamed uh it's been a fun conversation um I equally respect your work uh despite having different views on some of the things that we discussed I still think you Ahmed and a bunch of other folks in the industry are doing amazing work really respect all of the content that you put out and the effort that you put into everything that you're doing for the community so yeah uh thank you so much for the opportunity to speak uh the good thing is you picked the topic that I can speak on for the whole day long so it is not I was not running out of ideas um and yeah uh really enjoyed the conversation yeah amazing man thanks for your time and uh see you soon thank you so much.
