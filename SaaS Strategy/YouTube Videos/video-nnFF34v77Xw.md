hey everyone justin thomas here i'm the founder and lead consultant at journey engine today i'm going to run you through an end-to-end case study of how we drove organic growth for a growth stage b2b saas company called work vivo this is going to be a step-by-step breakdown of our exact framework that we run every client through really nothing is going to be left out from our process here so i think it's going to drive you a ton of value and i'm excited to get started so stand by so in this study again we're going to be running you through the exact process we use to generate an exponential lift in organic traffic sales qualified leads and fifteen thousand dollars savings in ppc cost per month the client was workvevo.com this is a collaborative web platform that combines social media networking with internal employee communication tools when the business came to us they already had a product market fit and they already had some growth they were becoming increasingly relevant in the era of remote work um in around 2019 when when cobit hit so they had a uh a definite product market fit but they did have a couple issues and challenges the biggest two problems were number one they were not driving enough awareness through organic traffic they were putting out a ton of content but that content was not driving users and uh overall their content was not driving qualified leads so the marketing team retained us to quickly roll out a campaign that would resolve these two issues and not only resolve those two issues but prove that those issues were resolved with hard data so the same framework we run through all of our clients we applied to this business only on an accelerated timeline which i'll explain in a second so each of these phases has deliverables associated and tied to it we're going to run through each piece of this framework and how we applied it for work vivo so the discover phase [Music] includes a competitive audit a website quality audit a traffic projection an roi projection report and a detailed long-term project plan the competitive intelligence audit is a report that we generate based on competitor data to get the lay of the land and again find out what white space we can attack for quick wins in the campaign uh we can identify where the top competitors are in terms of content and organic traffic metrics and we can identify the general tactics that they're using to drive traction in their business based on our findings with work vivos competitive audit we found that their content pillars were not as aligned as the competitions when it comes to their audience so the content they were generating was not really aligned to drive traffic from their ideal customers or to drive conversions for that matter that's the first thing we noticed the second thing is that the competitors were consistently generating a higher volume of content of new content pages each month they were also generating a higher velocity of quality backlinks to their content and their their pillar or their platform pages so this was causing them to have a significantly higher amount of overall organic traffic and also a higher ppc value so they were generating traffic from both upper funnel terms and lower funnel terms uh at a higher rate the website quality audit is a report that joins keyword volume traffic uh conversions and metadata from six different sources including uh google analytics google search console conversion data from hubspot data from screaming frog on metadata etc we run this report to make a decision on what action we recommend for every single page on the site so first thing we do is gather the data on all the sites pages second thing we do is lump those pages into sections and make a decision about what to do with them based on our findings in this report we found 86 content pages that we needed to prune for quality decide whether to merge remove refresh or rewrite those pages so this is actually a huge volume of existing content compared to a lot of uh businesses so they already had a full library of content going as i mentioned um and we needed to figure out why that content was not driving organic traffic and conversions we also found 14 lead generation pages so those are for a tech business the platform and the features pages that are intended to drive conversions in sales so we also needed to perform keyword research for those pages critique them from a conversion perspective and update them on page so the traffic projection analysis is a tool we built here internally it uses inputs from competitor data from organic traffic and conversion data and our own forecasting models to accurately predict a campaign's roi potential based on our findings in this case uh word vivo could expect a four to six times lift in traffic from an seo or content marketing campaign over the long term uh we did set some shorter term targets uh 60 lift in organic traffic by six months and a 100 lift in sales qualified leads from organic traffic in that same six months uh these lifts would be enough for an ample return on investment for the business and we set them as benchmarks going forward his needs i mentioned earlier that this was an accelerated uh timeline they wanted to rank and drive results really quickly we execute campaigns in based on sprints so again the deliverables are tied to each of those sprints and in the framework i mentioned earlier discover improve build and promote um so we planned a discover improve and build sprint all out of the gate in month one we also um put together a full project plan for every client with all deliverables and milestones attached to it and all delivery dates uh up front before we ever get started the next phase was improve so after we have our project plan and our uh detailed website quality audit in place uh and we know what we're going to do with every single page we move into improving the existing assets on this so we started with enhancing the pillar pages those product and feature sales pages that i mentioned earlier for these pages we do keyword research to identify the lower funnel keywords or the keywords that people in this market are using when they're already in the market for a similar product we based on our findings rewrite page titles rewrite meta descriptions provide an in-depth uh conversion critique and provide ux layouts to update the the pages from a conversion perspective and rewrite the body copy for each of those pages the 86 pages that we identified as content pages or blog articles or resources are intended to reach users earlier in the customer journey so the goal of these resources is to generate interest from the target audience to answer their important questions and story sell work vivo as the ideal solution they're less about sales and more about answering questions and generating awareness and interest and and uh top funnel leads um based on our findings we remapped their content to a proper pillar and cluster we use a pillar cluster framework which i'm going to go into more depth about in the coming pages but again we wanted to realign the content with their ideal target audience and make it more likely that the traffic they were generating is going to convert into qualified leads and sales for the business so we rewrote 11 of those blog articles to become more aligned in this regard we merged six of those pages together to make them into deeper topics and um refresh the metadata the page titles the topics based on our keyword research to drive more qualified traffic 11 of those pages we identified were pretty good and could already be targeted with links because their only shortcoming was that they weren't being promoted well enough after we had completed the content audit and the on-page optimization the next phase of the campaign was to build new content for the business so during this process we run a keyword gap analysis to identify exactly uh what topics the competition has used to drive traction and how we can leverage uh keywords from those examples we're building an exact content pillar and cluster strategy to develop new content topics going forward over the long term we're ideating new topics and new content tactics that the business can specifically use right away and we're writing detailed content briefs um for each of those topics and managing them through to production so the keyword gap analysis in this case is uh a report that scrapes data from the company's top competitors to find the best keywords that are driving traffic to their content pages we manually comb through all of this data and the from keywords and landing pages and come up with a pillar cluster strategy going forward so based on our findings here uh you could see some of the pillar and cluster groupings that we came up with we came up with 18 content pillars and 28 content clusters for this business next we formulate the detailed content strategy so after gathering internal inputs from the businesses stakeholders from the marketing and sales teams um we identified our initial ideal prospect that we wanted to go after which was the technical uh hr executive at globally distributed companies um we read an in-depth analysis on this group and several and several other tertiary audiences in order to find out the media that they're using the groups that they're part of the platforms that they're using etc and based on our findings we came up with some specific uh content tactics that and uh promotional tactics that we felt would best reach this audience next uh as far as content marketing operations uh really the hardest part of any content marketing and seo campaign is the actual execution the strategy is uh is a paramount importance as well but where most internal marketing departments and agencies fall short is actually getting this content uh published and distributed turning out high quality content on a consistent and regular basis so again we started with just one pillar that pillar of hr executives and around that pillar we developed 20 new content topics um to come out of the gate with we wrote content briefs for each of those topics including a detailed keyword framing and content outline which makes it easy to then go in get a writer to beef up the content brief and uh get that content scheduled through to production on a regular basis the next phase of the campaign was promotion so after our content our existing content and our new content is optimized and published to the site the most important component for rankings is uh quality and optimized backlinks so we start with a an analysis of the client's link profile we then prospect for publications and partners that will promote our content for us and we go about securing and negotiating um how to acquire those links in the most efficient way so we begin by prospecting for authoritative publications where hr executives get their information that would be willing to promote our content for us we do that by providing those publications and partners with valuable content that they would be very willing to share with their audience and then within that content um placing promotions for our content pages so uh we immediately out of the gate within uh the first month secured 15 publications um that were high quality and relevant to the audience publications like hrfuture.net hrnews.com and flippingbook.com uh we pitched content topics to them that they liked uh we got that content produced and we posted links back to our own internal content from those sites all of these sites were a minimum of 45 dr all the way up to a dr of 90 which is a metric we use to gauge the authoritativeness of of the blog and the likelihood that it will give us the power we need to drive organic traffic and rank for our target keywords so the final phase is uh the evaluation phase uh the impact tracking in roi now so transparent and consistent ongoing reporting against the roi milestones that we set at the beginning of the campaign is absolutely critical to the success of any project and this is an area where i feel that journey engine stands apart from the crowd we have built a structure here internally that we call a data pipeline that allows us to provide transparent always-on dashboards that give a clear view into how we're progressing against the targets that we set at the beginning of the campaign we do weekly project tracking updates to let our clients know where we're at in terms of the content cue and what open action items we have available for them uh what backlink promotions we are landing in in the status of those promotions on a consistent basis we do a monthly deep dive data analysis and objectives and key results analysis which we share through google data studio dashboards and and via screen share or in person meetings and then we do a quarterly business review and goal resetting where we're doing a deeper dive into how we're progressing against the objectives we said at the beginning of the campaign and making adjustments to those if needed so now i'll run you through the results of all of this effort and show you what the payoff was we over delivered on all projections that we set at the beginning of the campaign during the six months that we ran this campaign for we generated a 138 increase in total organic traffic which was uh over double what we had projected we projected a 60 increase in organic traffic um this included over a 500 percent lift in organic traffic to uh the content pages of the site so those blog articles and resources and a 56 lift in traffic to the pillar and platform pages again as i mentioned before they had 86 current pages on the site so refreshing rewriting and updating those pages drove a lift and traffic as well as the new content pages that we developed for that site so you can see kind of why the lift was so much higher in content and resource pages but we still had a dramatic lift in traffic to those those pillar pages as so in addition to generating big lifts in organic traffic we also generated a lot of value off the back of that organic traffic so one metric we use to determine traffic value is uh the ppc equivalent of our organic traffic so we generated fifteen thousand dollars more per month after our campaign than the client was generating uh prior to starting the campaign so a fifteen thousand dollar savings in ppc cost which was important for this business more importantly even than that we were driving exponentially more leads uh from the bottom of the funnel so uh the content that we recommended for them um the layouts that we did um the content upgrades that we were recommending were generating 11 times the sales qualified leads as they were generating from their organic traffic before so um yeah this is another area where i feel journey engine stands out is we're really able to see organic through traffic through all the way to sales qualified leads meaning uh leads that have been verified and have agreed to a sales call and the most important metric for us of course is very happy clients so uh the marketing team at this business um was very happy with the work we did you can check out their full review at clutch.com as well as a bunch of our other case studies here you can read the full review where he verifies all the results that we got for him and um in addition to getting results for him we also work with the marketing team to communicate uh these results with hard data um and kind of coach them through the process of using that data across their organization and communicating with uh with other departments which i think stands out as another value-add um that our team brings to the table so yeah if you want results like this i highly recommend that you get in touch with us for your free organic roi forecast um again you can go back to the beginning of this presentation and check out the process for forecasting roi and organic traffic off the back of it campaign it gives you an idea of what you can accomplish with a similar campaign as well as give you some early tactical ideas to get you started currently we're running this as a free promotion uh i don't think we're going to be doing this forever and we haven't always done it so if you're interested make sure to click the link below and get in touch as soon as possible and we are looking forward to working with you.
