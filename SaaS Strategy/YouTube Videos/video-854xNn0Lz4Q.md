## Transcript

Welcome back to the Grow Your B2B SAS podcast. Today I'm joined by Kristoff Shiskovich, also known as Chris, co-founder of Value Ships, a consultancy specializing in SAS pricing, monetization, and revenue expansion. In this episode, we'll dive into the future of SAS pricing in 2026, including the rise of hybrid pricing models, AIdriven cost structures, outputbased pricing, and advanced strategies to increase your NR. Chris explains how to structure tiers, uses metrics, AI add-ons, and valuebased pricing in a way that aligns with willingness to pay, but also expansion revenue. We will cover how often SAS companies should update pricing, how to run pricing experiments the right way, and why premium models are shifting, and the most common mistakes founders make when pricing a product in 2026.

So, there's a lot in there. So, let's go to Amsterdam as this episode is also recorded live at the SAS Summit in Benalux. Welcome to the Grow Your BB SAS podcast. >> Hello. >> Could you quickly introduce yourself? Who are you and what do you do? >> So, my name is Kushtokevich, but I go by Chris.

I'm co-founder of Value Shifts. We're a boutique pricing consultancy working mostly with technology sector. Most of our clients are products and right now SAS plus AI. >> Nice. Well, we're going to talk a lot about SAS and AI and pricing.

So, first question like how do you see SAS pricing evolving in 2026? So couple of things uh for like at first right so of course there are many discussions about you know outputbased and success based models I think we will see that even more more and more comp companies implementing that but also with competition becoming more and more fierce I think that more and more companies and I'm saying more and more for the fifth time but nevertheless I think more and more companies will focus also on expansion revenue so they will think how to package their product in a way that it supports expans and revenue use case which means that you really need to have good tiers you need to have like good limits yada yada yada and because I see NR being more and more important for the companies and of course price it needs to support NR growth right so I don't want to go into like trivia yes success will be there yes output will be will be there yes we will see first big success with output and or next success with output and uh h and like success with output and and success based pricing of course but beyond the trivia I think that the real growth will come from expansion revenue in 2026. >> Yeah. Yeah. And then expansion any kind of pricing or any kind of expansion. So not just I guess output base but it could be anything.

>> So when you think about this in order to support the expansion revenue use case you need to have two things. So first thing is like horizontal scaling which is scaling through the core value metrics right? So no matter if it's like usage based pricing, it's normal based pricing, you need to somehow scale with your c core value metric, of course the closer you are to the success of your customer, the more tangible is the value, the more you contribute to the value, the easier it is for the expansion revenues. Imagine that you are, I don't know, an intent software, right? If you're providing good value, if you are uncovering the intents, if you are supporting the sales of your customers, of course, naturally they will want they want to buy more and more intents for you. So it makes a lot of sense to have an output intentbased model crystal crystal tier. So horizontal scaling is scaling through value matching.

The other thing that it has been in SAS for quite a while is also vertical scaling. So vertical scaling is scaling by the functionalities. The more advanced advanced the software, the more more you pay. This is clear, right? More features, good, better, best, yada yada yada. Right? But I think that since competition is getting more fierce, you need to put a bit more research into differentiating through the advancement of your software.

In order to differentiate, you need to understand the preference and the willingness to pay. So just to make it crystal clear if you have features that are highly preferred and there is willingness to willingness to pay behind this they should separate your pricing tiers right so of course it has been here for a while but I think most of the companies were structuring their plans by the gut feeling right now we need to professionalize a bit >> yeah yeah and then when you professionalize a bit you mean uh like figuring out where where is the willingness to pay for certain feature but is it also I guess like professionalize as in making it a bit more hybrid putting a usage uh based component to it or value based component to it. >> Yes. Yes. Yes.

Yes. That's for sure. Definitely what I uh don't recommend and I don't think it it works very well is just to change your pricing model 180 uh 80° right so you are classic user based and nothing usage zero add-ons and now we want to be on the hype trail of AI we're going to do success based on top of it there will be a usage and the platform will be modular right so only a platform 100 add-ons most likely you might be successful but there is low chance that you will be successful with that. Right? So I think that you know when you develop your pricing model you should do do step by step. So you mentioned usage right? So what I think is that we will see more and more companies adding an AI add-on and then trying to experiment with that.

So pricing should be should be a process. If you want to test the waters if usage based pricing is for you and you are working on your cool new AI feature what you can do hey let's add it as an add-on and let's try the try to monetize it with use it right crystal clear see test the waters understand if there is a use case for you if the adoption is high if the adoption is high you see I don't know 15 20% of your clients using this software then you might think if you should change the whole monetization model more towards the the user based pricing for example. >> Yeah. Yeah. And I'm curious with um AI native companies coming more and more right and especially in 2026 AI has a lot more cost I guess to run a SAS company like do you see foresee that fremium will change or will be different or so here is the think right so I think that uh first of all when you think about usage for AI native companies if they are using output based pricing on with the usage component like usage is a new term right so if companies are actually not using your software.

I mean they are not active in your software, you are not getting paid problem, right? That is the first challenge uh that that I see. The second one when it comes to the premium then you might think that you know if you're a success base this is already premium with a commission based component right so I mean this is one nature of the fremium what we can see in the fremium is definitely and this is like very old concept that fremium is deteriorating your perceived value. What does it mean that if you have a premium on average you will be cheaper than your competition who doesn't have fremium? We have tons of benchmarks supporting this use case. So this is a bit bittersweet. I think that there will be companies who will experiment more with fremium but to be very honest I'm not sure if it's going to change much in 2026.

>> I think usage and you know being premium via success based this will be kind of a new new premium. >> Yeah. Yeah. because it is a good way to get new users in and then actually get them to the value you want. It's a human man.

It's a commission based model, right? Think about and you know we're in products, we're in SAS, this is a great conference where we are talking about success blah blah blah stuff like this and we think like yeah success based such a new great model how innovative it is. I'm like hey guys have you seen booking.com I mean this company has been around for like couple of years already and they are success based right? This is a commission model. So if you think about this, I mean you can subscribe as a hotel to booking.com and they are only charging you when the conversion happens on the booking.com purely a success-based model. So I'm I think that you know product ecosystem has a lot of to catch up with from marketplaces where they can learn from uh when it comes to success commissions but uh yeah this will be exciting for sure. >> I don't think I have to ask should you change pricing or how often do you should you change pricing because I you're going to say like you have to change pricing probably a lot.

No, here's the thing. It's a, you know, two, three years ago, most likely I would have said, "Yeah, yeah, just think about this once a year." But right now, with the speed of development, new features, with the competition getting more and more exciting, so to say, I think that the time now is to treat pricing as a process, right? So, you should think no matter what product decision you are taking, no matter what people decision you you are taking, always take into consideration pricing plans. you know we are adding a bit of value shell does it require to change pricing adjust pricing is there a monetization use case in that right so I think that as we are treating marketing sales as a process right now is the time to treat pricing as a process and actually constantly work on it it doesn't require always a change not acting is always uh a decision that you can take but yeah I think now it's a time pricing is a process let's make this you know hashtag popular >> are you already running an affiliate or referral program, but is not really driving growth.

Well, pricing process is almost like pricing running pricing experiments like you're changing something running experiment.

Does it actually work? Like how would you test it? because probably you're not going to test on the entire user base, right? >> So definitely couple of things, right? So first we need to separate like the new users and existing users, right? So if you're present in the couple of markets, you're a big SAS solution with tons of hundreds of thousands of views on your website. You can might you might think of AB testing, different plans, price tags, not really, but you know, different plans uh different packaging, you know, three plans versus four plans, how does it work, blah blah blah, stuff like this. But this is only reserved from the biggest companies that can have that that can make their AB test statistically significant. If you're a bit smaller company, I would say the first thing that you should you need to do when it comes to pricing tests, I mean current users do a simple uh matrix, right? So think in terms of a revenue concentration on one axis you need to have like know the percentage of revenue on the other axis you should you should have uh percentage of clients, right? So you typically see that 20% of your clients depending on the use case are responsible for 60 80% of your revenue give or take right but then you have this 10 20% of the companies who are only responsible for 1% of the revenue this is your uh play maybe we shouldn't call it a playground but this is your testing ground. So if you want to test the waters see something how does the influence your revenue stuff like this this is where you can experiment a bit number one.

Number two, if you think about experimentation, also think uh what is your break even point in terms of a churn, right? So you have a bit of a risk in testing. You want to introduce something, you don't know if it works, if it doesn't work. So see what churn you can actually afford if the test fails because some of the test will fail. That's fine. If they prove or disprove the hypothesis should push your business forward.

Nevertheless, uh you should also be aware of the risks. >> Yeah. And I think that's it. like you're definitely going to have some churn I guess with some experiments you're going to run but in the end if the the revenue you get extra from it is actually positive then it's not a bad experiment it's not a bad change thing to do probably they won't be the best clients to have anyway break even point right this is the break even point when you think about this frequently before we are launching a pricing experiment or pricing uplift for our clients we see that you know we are increasing the prices by 10 20 30% whatsoever so the first task things that we are do we are seeing how much turn we can afford to break even and sometimes 20 30%. Can you imagine that 20% of your clients are leaving because you increase prices by 20%.

If yes, most likely pricing is not your problem, right? So yeah, I mean that's that's but of course like you know I don't want to generalize if you are more in the commoditized business it's a bit more tricky. If you're more on the innovation side, it shouldn't be that tricky nitty-gritty details, but in general, you know, taking or understanding your break even point is a very very important thing in pricing. >> Yeah. Yeah. And I think these are probably already some common mistakes or I guess like traps to avoid, but what what do you typically see happening like mistakes happening right now within pricing within SAS companies? >> So there there there are a couple right so there there are two mistakes that I will mention that has been here for for a while.

So first one discounting grandfathering right. So if you're changing the prices always take the decision if you should do that for currently existing clients. Number one gathering number two discounting right understand how many of your customers are p are you are charging below your current list price in case this is 10% of revenue leaking try to seal them try to bring them back to the current plan they are your happy users frequently ambassadors that shouldn't be that hard. So if you're not doing that, not monitoring it actually it's a mistake right if you don't uh if you are facing some challenge is not a priority not acting on that it's not a uh mistake but not reviewing it is a mistake. Second one that I see no matter how big is your company is actually being too furious when it comes to changing the pricing model.

I mentioned this already, right? So, we are in the tornado now with AI. That's for sure. Especially in pricing. So, I see many companies who just want to be on the hype train and they want to change their monetization method fully from day one to the other. Not uh like typically it takes or you should do it step by step.

Number two, and number three, credits. So, credits amazing model. You can have great success, play stuff like that. they did amazing thing things with credits. But if you're a point solution and if you're just solving one use case and then you just randomly have credits which means that you uh you you basically exchange dollar to credits and then this one credit to one thing that we are buying.

I mean this is just an an intermediary step that could have been neglected. So being too hyped with credits if you're a very you can be great doing amazing things but we are just a point solution solving one thing most likely credits is not the thing that should work for you if you're more complex that's for sure it can work >> that and I mean we're working on it oursel right now like credit is also a way to make sure that people don't misbehave AI right because there's a lot of cost related to it so often you put credits in place just to make sure that you're not having a higher cost than actually income antra right not anti fraud but actually you know negative margin you know there are some like credits can be one most likely leverage solution that you can use amazing there a couple of others right so there is something like that is called freight fair trade usage policy so I'm not sure if you know but if you have unlimited data plan in your phone or if you have unlimited calling plan in your phone my friend this is not unlimited right so when you think about this uh I mean there is a limit in terms and conditions those things are called fair trade usage policies and Again those thing has been in the market for quite a while. We as a SAS ecosystem we need to catch up a bit and introduce fair trade usage policy into our contract. So if you're thinking about having unlimited AI plan in your solution if for some reason this is the best use case for you great make yourself a favor and make sure that you have a fair trade uh policy behind that in your contract. And then what does it mean time when you are receiving a negative margin from this like AI most likely this is the block time right so you you know before your customers are reaching 10 20% of the thresholds there should be a pop-up saying hey look uh this is the situation fair trade usage policy that that's it right so credits one one option the fair trade usage policy other option there is a third one as well so the third one is a trueups right so if you see that monthto-month companies are using too much I mean you can true them up your taxes is working, how your energy prices are working, right? You predefine some usage on the electricity and then government or like electricity company threw you up every year or every month.

We can do the same. >> Interesting. Interesting. We're going to dive into the final two questions which are more revenue related questions. Um, what kind of advice would you give a SAS founder who's just starting out and growing to 10K monthly recurring revenue right now? >> It's pretty simple.

Differentiate, right? So at the at the very beginning I think that your one and only uh goal with pricing I mean it needs to be okay pricing but it shouldn't be that hard but I think it you you should make yourself a favor and learn as much as possible which means that if you have all-in-one solution uh and you know only one price for one plan after a year you are just just in the same spot where you've started right when with regards to pricing related knowledge I would say that if you're starting Think how you can differentiate your solution. How to make it at least good, better, how to uh respond to the use case ICPS that you are uh you are targeting and try to think you know one price that is X the other price is 120% X. After a year you will see which plan your customers are choosing why they are choosing this plan. Maybe if they are 95% of the your customers are choosing the most expensive plan. Maybe you're too cheap.

If 95% of your customers are using the cheapest plan, you are giving too much value in this uh cheapest plan. So I would say that if your uh solution is rich enough or in most of the cases the solutions are reach enough would be to differentiate and experiment a bit. Treat pricing as process. >> Nice. And let's assume now we passed 10K MR.

We're going to make a huge step towards 10 million AR. So for people who are on that journey from 10K to to 10 million, what kind of advice would you give here? So I would guess like there there are three things right. So first of all if you want immediate impact I mean look at your discounting policies and grandfathering policies. This is the easier easiest uh revenue to unlock. If you're leaking more than 10% of your revenue it act on it.

Number one. Number two look into your expansion revenue toolkit right so how you can actually expand your clients. Do you have pricing plans differentiated enough? Do you have add-ons in place? Do you have some usage component in your solution? So I mean look what your toolkit your CSM has in order to allow for the expansion. Third one, if you decided to take your price tax/ packaging by gut feeling, by competition a bit, by cost, stuff like this, I mean at 10 million ARR, it's worth to invest a bit in the research, especially primary research to understand if you are not underpricing because from my experience, 95% of our projects, we increase the average price for our customers. If it's got feeling plus competition plus cost, there's 95% of the chance that you are too cheap.

>> I think that's a great ending. >> Thank you very much. Thanks for having me and you know did my best. >> Perfect. If people want to get in contact with Chris, how can they do so? >> So LinkedIn.

So just looked for value ships and there will be this guy with like a very strange name and surname. That's me, right? And with a mustache on the on the phone. >> Nice. We'll add the link so people can just click it. >> Yeah, that's easier, right? >> Thanks, Chris.
