## Transcript

welcome to the first fireside chat of our community summer camp for those that don't know we start at Community summer camp somewhere at the beginning of this quarter it's a campaign that we're running for the entire quarter and the aim is to bring back memories or the spirit of summer camp which some of you might have experienced as well um we probably all remember camp and it needs to be a fun experience obviously but also some might describe it as a very educational experience so we decided to combine both and then Center it around what I would say is a camp favorite subject which is community building or just Community I think also for summer camp Community seems kind of like a logical thing so it's probably also how we got to it to help me make sense of the more creative strategies around building Community we've invited Eric Martin you can see him on screen PP of services at comsor hey Eric hey excited excited to be here and yeah it's uh I I think I think uh summer camp and uh Community go go hand in hand so yeah have you have you actually experienced summer camp I I was just thinking about this not only have I uh experienced summer camp and went to a lot of uh camps as a kid I actually have my first like real job was teaching or being a counselor uh at summer camps really yeah I did like a sort of very you know small local generic sort of you know summer camp where you did a little bit of everything and then I also taught at a at a tennis camp so I think I think Camp counts camp counselor and like Community professional there's a lot of similarities um yeah this is awesome I didn't know we could not have planned this better who writes these scripts it's amazing I know I feel like if I need like splinters or uh dealing with bee stings I'm still like world class even though I haven't done it in decades oh there we go let's hope that doesn't happen during this webinar I mean crazier stuff has happened during inside of webinars but we'll see so we'll have Eric intro himself at first a little housekeeping yes we will record the webinar yes we will also send it to you afterwards don't worry if you have any questions just post them in the chats like some people have done already introducing themselves hello uh everyone from Oklahoma and Canada um and if you have questions and do post them in the chat I'll try to weave them into conversation as uh as much as possible um it's that I have two children in the back so if you guys hear screaming I do apologize uh and also it's crazy hot in here so if I start sweating during the webinar uh it's probably true to that I think we'll see are we good to go Eric yeah let's do this awesome all right then to start us off uh please tell us a little bit about yourself and your past Community experience because uh some people might have checked your LinkedIn and seen some pretty amazing companies there yes I'd love to hear uh yeah uh yeah welcome everyone um see a few familiar names in the chat already but yeah I got started in this world of community um actually from the marketing side um I was doing marketing for a lot of independent films uh smaller music projects basically entertainment things without a very big budget and so got into all these different communities that were emerging you know very early social media Forum days early early 2000s and then was lucky enough to be the first Community manager and fifth employee at a little company called Reddit um and worked there for six years uh was a general manager uh by the end of that for the last few years and worked on everything from from Community to you know ad sales all kinds of stuff uh and then uh did a bunch of different Community things since then uh launched a company called depop in the US which is an amazing sort of community-based version of eBay if you're not familiar lots of cool fashion stuff that I was never cool enough to actually uh pull off in person but I love the community there uh love the marketplace uh also worked in place we're trying yeah I mean yeah they tried to help me but I was beyond beyond beyond help but um uh then also yeah did Community uh at wework especially uh uh how do you build community between people who are in the office spaces but but worldwide across you know cities and countries uh which was really exciting uh also did some Community projects at Nike as an entrepreneur in Residence uh Miranda Community for job Seekers at a company called teal and then recently I joined comstor about a year ago and at comsor I help companies um with uh hiring hiring Community professionals and then also Consulting on community strategy awesome awesome that's quite a list and also the names of the companies on the list are super impressive so I have some questions about them uh in a second but first we're here to talk engagement strategies so what is engagement to you I mean I to me it's like how do you you know my very like simple definition of community or the lens I look at it through is is the members talking with each other or interacting with each other right um that's uh why ideally you know what's driving a lot of the activity in communities people talking directly to each other whether that's on slack a forum inside it at an event in person whatever but if they're talking directly with each other at scale to me that's that's the sort of building block of community and engagement is like how do you increase that right how do you increase the the nodes or the uh the links in between the nodes in the network to use a sort of network language but like how do you how do you get more connections between people um and a scale that starts to have emerging patterns and subgroups and all kinds of interesting stuff but really like I think how do I get more people talking to each other how do I get more people introduced to each other so that they can start building those connections yeah yeah exactly I think especially in B2B would probably also in b2c this is usually seen as the Holy Grail of of building Community you need to see engagement otherwise it's dead and you need to see more engagement and preferably also growing engagement month over month to sort of Define your community program as a success so if you for example look back at Reddit then because engagement with Reddit doesn't really seem a problem was there still something that was top of mind that you were trying to trying to measure increase yeah I think the the sort of simple beauty of the Reddit system was that it'll it um you know relatively early on but not at the beginning anyone can create a subreddit right so if you are in the subreddit for your local city or a political you know belief or or cause or video game you're a fan of whatever and you don't like the way it's run or you think it's gotten too big you want something more intimate you want something more focused on XYZ you can create a new subreddit um and over time a lot of those you know it's it's a lot of those subreddits have sort of forked and now have you know there's there's not just one subreddit around a given topic there's there's 20 and some of them are you know super Niche some of them are are more you know informal some of them are super serious and and you know the full of jargon but I I think that's what's really been amazing for engagement on Reddit is that you know when the the communities there didn't have the the curse of success where okay there's a great Community for a TV show or video game or whatever um and it becomes so big that what made it amazing in the first place is now lost um you know that happened but then when it happened people could kind of overflow and move into these other spaces um and I think that's something that you know uh somehow the the recipe the ingredients in Reddit worked very organically um but you know those of us in sort of community building especially in B2B spaces try to um balance as well like okay we now have critical mass maybe we start opening up local local sub you know channels or sub forums but you don't want to do too early and spread people too thin um so that's uh that's one of the things I think about a lot is like how do you create those sort of different Forks or or Warrens or little subgroups um and yeah it's a there's no it's it's a art art and science there and it truly it is yeah so if you're because you're now at home store for example we all know the Community Club slack channel uh which we all love so would you say there are major differences between what you've seen at Reddit for example and trying to keep members engaged and trying to keep everyone engaged in the community clubs like Channel uh yeah I think the basics are are are pretty similar um and you know the basics are true across all of the all of the communities I've been a part of you know those basic rules like uh you know the 9010 rule or the 99 1 rule in terms of you know uh you know the the 10 of super users are going to be responsible for 90 of the the content or engagement that's that's true you know no matter what medium and platform and subject you're in um but I think the the professional Community uh that we're building for Community people at comsor and Community Club um yeah engagement there is interesting because you have so many different perspectives coming in you have people and I think that's the challenging part you have people who are looking to um you know learn more about Community because they're interested maybe in pivoting from from you know from higher education from customer support from adjacent fields from marketing and they want to you know maybe their next gig they're looking at something in Community Management you have people who been in the field longer than I have you have people who are you know working for b2c you know Brands and B2B software and so balancing all of that I think not just in com Source slack but sort of when when we talk about the community industry itself and and the spaces where we talk to each other I think that's always the challenges Broad and beautifully expanding uh uh topic so how do we how do we uh you know you know talk about the things that we all share but also uh create create spaces where we can talk specifically about our our section of the ecosystem is uh is always a challenging challenging yeah exactly yeah I read I think two days ago or something that um I think it's now the 55 25 20 rule is what the community Roundtable calls it now so it's no longer 1991 or 99 one yeah I think anyway it's changing probably probably is uh data back then and wealth researched I don't know I haven't read it yet but uh that's what I read at least um so maybe let's just Deep dive into the concept of Engagement and how um you get people to engage so one of the first things that we at least always hear um is that Community is a quite a heavy load on a team because you just need to do so much to at least get it started and then hopefully reach that Pinnacle Point where a community grows by itself and you have members participating in everyone else um and I think the first thing that is a roadblock for most teams is content so how have you in your experience um or maybe now or in the past approached content and content generation this is something that you've done yourself and hired people to do or did you find clever ways to actually get content to scale for your community yeah so I think yeah content especially at the beginning when you're trying to get that that critical mass and I I think there's a it's a challenge and there's a few things you can do to make it um easier on yourself and also easier for the for the members to understand how to jump in um and I think of content as like a like a genre right like so you want to create enough enough of a container enough of a brand or boundary around the activity um so that people can come in and they understand what's expected of them and how to participate how to play in the game so you know they understand that if it's a if it's a western there's going to be horses and cowboy hats and you know there's all sorts of freedom and flexibility within that that space but they understand the basics of of the game and I think there's a few content types that that can work well for that so um you know something like asking people I mean one we we use as a in in or in most communities is like you know sharing pet photos right that's a great one uh where people can yeah it's not gonna it's not gonna uh you know do everything you want out of the community but as far as like an easy low friction way to get people to start sharing something that's a good one um you know sharing uh wins people have achieved usually on Fridays is another one that very like you know it's it's obvious when people come in okay here's what I'm supposed to do here um a place where people can you know easily ask for help or connections or if someone knows something someone knows someone at a company you know ask for an intro this type of Channel depending on the community can make sense and and I would say uh whether that's a Channel or that's sort of a recurring content prompt um the clearer it can be for the members of the community but also for your own team um you want to make it as as clear as possible so that it's very easy to to you know come up with with a new way or you know come up with something for that week um so uh you know almost by by narrowing in the the topic the type of content it's sort of an enabling constraint there because uh it's it's easier to come up with with something so yeah exactly that um also yeah deputizing sort of community members um early on uh and and the key there you know is to ask them to to participate for a for a finite period of time so say Hey you know we love the stuff love you know love the things you've been posting or sharing or answering in the community um you know uh there's a week next month for that week would you mind sharing something you know uh once once a day just for five days or would you mind sharing something every Monday this coming month uh just make the ask really really you know clear but also you know a finite period of time just for just for 10 days five days whatever and I think that that makes it easier for them to say to say yes and and really commit to it and do the work because they know it's not a forever thing so that's another that's another thing I found to work when you're sort of uh trying to you know deputize ambassadors or super users or ask members of the communities to participate yeah I like that I especially like the finite part of it uh it's pretty smart so when do you start deputizing community members is that something you can actually start out with when you're starting a new community and maybe the SEC second question is also uh can you also do that in B2B absolutely um I think you can start you know I I don't think there's such a thing as starting you know too early uh within reason um because you know the earlier uh and if it's still in the early days and the sort of beta or private private beta version with Community then you're really um making those members feel like they're part of sort of building this and and they are it's not it's not just superficial they're really helping to set the tone and the the the direction and the the sort of vibe of the space um and so you can ask them early on um and and or at least ask them you know what types of you know what are the things you wish were covered in our industry that you that you don't see or the types of discussions what are the things we should be talking about in our industry that we're not um or you're not uh finding the right sort of peers to talk with about and and start there and yeah and then as far as um uh in B2B space absolutely I think um what I've found is maybe the uh sort of in uh in intrinsic incentive is a little bit different um versus the b2c space and and B2B the the people who make really good you know uh super users or or sort of content ambassadors and space leaders are they're trying to find their voice right they they they may be you know maybe their boss or whatever told them to be to create more content and sort of be a thought leader and and but they haven't figured out you know what type of stuff to share or what their little niche is um so doing so in a in a B2B you know Community gives them a sort of built-in audience even if it's super small and sort of a safe space to experiment with you know uh posting content that prompts discussion with leading you know leading small groups with uh you know curating content on their own so that's I think what I found the best the best sort of uh content prompt type people in a B2B space are looking for they're looking to to experiment and sort of get better at the craft of doing that in a in you know somewhere that's not out on uh out on LinkedIn or or you know a huge ocean of social media where they can really get some feedback and figure out um you know what works for them yeah yeah I think commonly people usually consider B2B to be too much technical content maybe even especially if it's a community for like a software product or something else um and that technical content being difficult to get into or engage with uh with the majority of what they would consider their Community I guess um do you what what do you what do you think of the notion of B2B being too technical to actually sort of have engagement around these topics um obviously there's there's uh a certain you know Baseline level of knowledge it's probably needed uh um from a technical perspective in some of these communities but I think um especially when you're able to have a wide range of experience levels um uh which is pretty common in these types of communities that can help some too so you can and and that's where the job of the community manager it's important to say you know hey most of us are experts in XYZ but we do have people who are coming in who may not be as familiar so you know really really try to make sure there's a entry point that explains things in more lay persons terms or oh if you're you know a software engineer but you're not familiar with this particular language this is the sort of Paradigm we're talking about um and if you have different levels in the community in terms of experience and knowledge that'll happen that'll happen naturally you know people will ask questions who are sort of new to the air new to the space um and more experienced people will will be able to answer and I think in general you know as long as it doesn't become uh overwhelming as long as people are asking you know specific questions uh the people with more experience are are usually uh excited to to you know talk about what they know and give back uh so I think yeah that's that's a the great thing about having a you know different different levels inside inside a community even if it's pretty technical yeah exactly yeah you already touched upon member participation a little um I remember when I was still at a huge Dutch Telco and we also had a community mainly q a but we had a community and I think the most or at least the best thing we could do for someone that had shown they were engaging around a certain subject or answered a lot of questions around certain subjects it's just give them a title right iPhone expert or something like that which actually it was it was a working title back then and people seem to love that kind of stuff so but is that something that is still sufficient or how how do you guys basically treat members that for example in the community club slack channel are truly participating or yielding a lot of value for all other members yeah I think I mean in in uh you know the sort of messy ephemeral conversational uh uh nature of slack makes it maybe a little bit more challenging to sort of uh add you know titles and badges and those sorts of things um versus versus more you know robust platforms like like inside it certainly but um I I think some of that happens organically I think the nice thing about you know these sort of messy platforms is you you you've learned those things over time so there's these sort of almost like inside jokes or or you know someone you'll see like wow this person's really good at mentioning people who might be able to answer this question um and those those sort of reputations and the the you know what people are known for internally um yeah it's a little it takes a little more time but it's a little more organic so I think uh uh you know there's there's advantages to both but certainly that's something that I think um I know in community club we could certainly do a better job of making it clear like okay this person is an expert in in XYZ so when they answer um their uh you know that that should be taken into account um yeah and I think over time these all of these sort of communities of practice and different support communities um the the activity individuals do in those members uh you know the value they're giving for other other members um you know it's going to be easier to to sort of uh travel with them outside of outside of that particular Community yeah it would be you know the same way if you're you know if I'm trying to hire a developer and they share their uh you know uh uh stack profile I can see all the amazing really difficult thorny questions they've been able to to help someone with they probably know what they're doing so I think that'll be the case uh in other communities as well yeah I I always struggle with sort of these types of recognition a little bit because uh it can also limit conversation from other community members uh because people will then be Scouting For the ones with the colored names or the fancy titles or something else versus just accepting an answer from anyone that's trying to contribute and probably maybe also has uh has a has the right answer so yeah it's always uh it's it's a it's an interesting thing but if you have a growing Community then probably also less of a less of a problem so we have about nine minutes left and I want three and I want to cover three more things so we're gonna do we're gonna do that quickly so the first is team let's imagine a random B2B software company who should be involved with the community project internally um I would say uh I I and I'm not just saying it's going to be glib like uh most of the company right most of the company uh you know unless it's huge but if it's a it's a random B2B software company that's of a you know small or medium size um everyone should be involved especially in terms of once the once the beta once the private version is launched and at least being somewhat active during those critical early first few weeks um to make sure there's a there's a critical mass and critical uh sort of level of audience and and you know everyone who joins the community gets welcomed or messaged um so that's that's one thing I point out but in general I would say uh you know definitely definitely support definitely marketing um and definitely someone at the executive level who can really see the you know the great thing about and the powerful thing about Community is it cuts across all the traditional all the traditional sort of silos right um we did a commsor did a community report earlier this year and looked at where Community teams sit uh in terms of you know under which sort of c-suite department at organizations and it was all over the place marketing and support were the most popular but they were you know you know mature amazing Community teams that sit under r d or product or operations or like tomsor have their own sort of c-suite Department um and and those all make sense so the nice thing about Community is that it can touch every part of the business um so uh I think that's also that's also challenging because it's it's different from company to company even if they're similar B2B software companies so I would say uh you know something like uh you know to make sure you have you have some uh you know c-suite uh executive level uh support and sponsorship and and um uh but then also uh definitely want to make sure your your involved heavily involving both both marketing and support um anyone who's who's interacting with the with the users with the customers as well yeah I like that I totally agree uh it's a shame that it's still so hard for so many B2B companies to actually get this done especially on the executive side uh it's very hard to get people to actually engage or at least be engaged with the project so it's a it's a shame but hopefully that grows uh I think it has grown a lot also in the in the past two years or so as Community has also evolved a little um so maybe transitioning to what is also important for them which is kpi so when you when you're building out engagement strategies campaigns everything else for uh for Community what would you uh what would you consider solar kpis to look at and what would you be looking at yourself yeah you know again the great thing about communities they can touch all the parts of the business um which also makes picking you know those one or two important uh kpis uh challenging because there's you know uh quite a few that you could you know logically pick from um I would say you want something that has to do with something that has to do with growth right uh referrals is one I like a lot and not just NPS but actual referrals you know has someone in the community referred another another customer another member are they inviting people uh other people inside their team at a customer account so actually being able to track that um you know ideally you can you can track it in terms of the actual referrals but even surveying and saying hey have you invited someone into this community or told someone about this community in the past 30 days or whatever something like that is important um it is a good way to measure measure sort of the organic growth of the community and the word of mouth and then something in terms of in terms of retention so uh especially if you can track it on a cohort basis to see where your work where your you know changes and and uh initiatives are having an impact so looking at you know how whatever sort of Engagement Cadence makes sense uh some communities that make sense for people to come daily some weekly some monthly but whatever it makes sense for you um looking at what's that pattern over time because uh potentially like monthly active users daily active users those kinds of permissions yeah and and and what's the you know how does that change change uh you know usually people are going to be oftentimes more engaged in their first week or month um and then there's a drop off uh which is part of that's natural but how do you know what can you do to make sure that people are coming back even if they've been there already for six months or three months or three years uh so I think that's as long as you have uh you know one kpi that's sort of more on the growth side um and one that's more on the retention side that'll that'll steer you in the right direction yeah exactly so how do you how do you see and maybe two questions so how have you seen Community evolve in the last year or so because I think it's become a little different especially from a B2B perspective um and also where do you see Community going uh in the next two years or something sure so I actually same same sort of answer for both questions and and uh I I find so there's something called a community of practice um and there's there's different types of community and different ways to sort of uh slice and dice them but but you know we Define a Community Practice um as people who are who are peers and they're given profession or or Endeavor so uh comsource Community Club which is a you know in our case a slack Community for Community professionals would be a Community Practice um uh whereas uh you have other types of communities are like a community product or a support Community or a customer Community um those have been around a little bit longer but the communities of practice we're really starting to see those pick up uh especially in the B2B space I think you know like a lot of things accelerated by the by the pandemic but you're seeing even in super Niche Fields uh companies are create basically creating a community where their target audience can talk with each other can talk with the peers um and uh you know sort of independently people have created those to be relatively agnostic of the company that's you know providing the space or sponsoring the space so um you know the other day I learned about a company they make software for gymnastics studios that's what they do just for Generations no other you know if you're doing a fitness studio or whatever aerobic Studio no but just gymnastics videos so they created a community for people who run gymnastics studios very Niche audience there's a thousand people in it it's on a Facebook group but it works awesome for them and I think we're seeing more and more of those especially as the you know economy maybe maybe flattens or goes down just because you know when there's uncertainty people are trying to figure out how to do more with less um you know maybe maybe people are laid off or nervous about their next job people want to talk with their peers um yeah big uptick in those uh I think that's also a good point to make is that you don't need 50 000 customers to be able to start a community project you can also do it with a hundred very engaged customers that can definitely help you out there um I think that's a good call to make and you already brought up the economy that was going to be my final points that's a nice sort of segue into the economy so maybe uh to give to give my sort of view so I feel like especially in B2B and software SAS uh a lot of companies are currently being asked to be at least more efficient and I think Community actually plays a really nice role when it comes to being more efficient as a company and being more efficient with customers and customer communication and maybe even digital engagement Digital customer success all of those subjects um so how do you view the role of a community in uh in what we should probably call like economic uncertain times sure so I mean I uh I'll review myself but you know Community can touch all the parts of business and I think Community can can actually make all the parts of the business more efficient so on the support side obviously people can can help uh you know curate and crowdsource and answer answer and and raise and identify problems uh or issues or Integrations or whatever um more efficiently than just a you know traditional um manual approach um on the marketing side community and and word of mouth and people inviting their the people they know uh can be you know way more efficient than you know paid ads and all of these other things that are that are half diminishing returns um and then I think maybe the most important but the most uh hard to quantify aspect of being efficient is community can tell you where to go and where not to go um so with limited resources you have to be really smart about the choices you make what to invest in what bets to make um where to focus where to not focus anymore and if you can listen to your community if you can you know listen both both passively as an observer and sort of uh in an effort of knowledge capture but also actively um by asking your community members and you know as a whole or in small groups um and and get their feedback before you invest too much resources in in a direction that maybe is is not gonna not gonna be fruitful uh I think that's where a community can save companies tons of money but that one's a little bit harder to quantify it's harder to quantify but I don't know I feel like it's just a logical explanation of what a community actually is uh can also do for you I think I think the fine the only thing I would add to that is that um and everyone should realize that their customers are going through the same thing so if they're providing a location for customers to actually have those discussions with you and with each other and everything else that would be a massive help and a massive opportunity I think also for uh yeah for a company um I want to end with two questions from carmelito uh the first is can you elaborate on some useful metrics to report to management in a community of practice yeah uh so the important metrics in the community practice I would say is again referrals right so if you're creating this community for a specific area practice of an emerging profession a discipline you know people that are in sales Ops or something like that um the the primary motivation there the value prop is that people come to talk to each other to their peers and so if they're not inviting their peers then there's something you know there's something not not quite right that needs to be adjusted so looking at you know do people actually refer invite um share uh talk about this community in terms of word of mouth is is a really useful one um and then as far as reporting to to management um yeah then it would be like how many how many of our customers are in this space um and do those customers on average you know you know spend more money larger accounts uh whatever whatever makes sense retain more whatever the right Revenue uh metric is for you um uh because you're you're sort of saying like people that are in this community are better customers um so those are the two types of metrics I think would be most useful for most cases um uh for communities of practice awesome thank you for that I hope that helps Carmelita and then the final question uh recently I had a potential client tell me that they have too much to do already and they feel it's not the right time to start a community when is the right time to start a community yeah um yeah I mean if if uh you know a client or the executives or whoever uh the decision makers yeah uh feel it's not the right time that you don't want to uh yeah it probably isn't just because if they're not bought in it's going to be really difficult not impossible but difficult um I would say the right time is is you know has to do with the with the with the demand on the side of the the user so the right time is when you feel like there's a there's a gap there's a need out there uh your your customers or potential customers um if they don't have a place to talk to their peers if they don't have a place to talk about your product um they they they're you know there's value in them talking again members talking to each other if there's a real need for that a hunger for that whether it's on the Community Practice side or Community product side um that's when it's the right time to start a community um and uh yeah it's a it's a great thing to gauge but that's when it really makes sense because there's a real demand from the from the users themselves yeah and I would also say that if that demand exists and you don't do it somebody else will yeah so I think that's also super important to keep in mind if they're truly in your space is a is a reason for uh for your customers prospects other people to just connect around the subject then you might as well try and own it right Carmelita says cool thank you very much so I think that is uh I think that is a perfect answer we're also out of time so I would like to thank you Eric for spending roughly 30 to 40 minutes with us and sharing your knowledge I would like to thank everyone in the audience for actually being here that was pretty amazing um two final things so this was the first of the Fireside Chats of the community summer camp campaign there will be two more one will be around building a community team and the other will be around vendor selection getting buy-in internally Etc uh one with mache from BMC and the other with Katie Ray from well no longer with Clarita but now with metadata so two awesome sections or sessions sorry will be announced later and as mentioned this recording will be shared as soon as possible thank you everyone for being here uh see some thank yous in the chat thank you thank you um and we hope to see you guys oh uh one one more thing we should talk about actually uh uh our companies have actually collaborated on a free uh learning module so over in c-school uh we have a new course that we just put up today that we actually partnered with insighted on uh called driving customer success through Community um so the course isn't
