wait another minute or two to kick this off uh feel free to uh join the chat and let us know where you're joining us from okay we'll begin in exactly one minute do oh cool yeah I see we have some folks uh someone from Mongolia and Brazil glad to have every everybody on okay let's let's kick this off uh this is a session that uh I'm really excited about doing uh wanted to wanted to do this uh event for for a while we have some fantastic speakers here today and we're going to be talking about a really important topic so many vertical SAS companies start with an initial product uh a product that solves uh a big enough paino for a group of uh customers but then over time it becomes harder to acquire new customers and one of the ways to continue and grow is to add more products into the platform we have with us today some uh amazing leaders from vertical SAS companies that have gone through this journey uh and have built really successful companies and this is what we're going to be talking about today my name is eai sadan I'm the CEO and co-founder of Duda and we have been a partner and a vendor to many of uh the SAS companies uh out there who have gone through this journey of going multiproduct and uh our our product a website builder for digital marketing and agencies has served them uh with a way to continue and grow and expand uh their revenue so my point of view is going to be as a a partner on the other side of the table to many of these uh great leaders that we have here uh I'll start with introducing our panel today we have here Andrew Walsh partner at tidark prior to joining tidark Andrew started his investing career at Bess Venture partners Ure Capital firm where he was focused on early stage investment in Enterprise software and consumer internet uh Andrew was a board Observer at toast disco and toggle and many other uh great SAS uh companies um part of what we'll be talking today with Andrew about is uh the the vertical SAS knowledge project which is a really interesting project that uh tidark has worked on and you can can find that on their website and that that project encapsulates a lot of their experience and learnings from working with many different uh vertical SAS companies uh in the industry we also have uh Arad Jam Arad was the former head of global Business Development and Innovation at Cloud kitchens he was also the former Chief growth officer at service Titan wet service Titan andard built multiple product lines that contribute today to millions of dollars of ARR things like credit cards checks customer business uh financing payroll payables email Automation and the list goes on and on so arshad definitely has a ton of experience on launching uh different products we'll talk about that and then lastly we have Jason Richards who is the vice president of strategy and corporate development at cloudbeds the hospitality management platform powering reservations for lodging businesses around the globe Jason has LED three successful Acquisitions and has been instrumental in developing clouds beds Global goto Market engine so thank you guys for uh joining us on this panel thanks for having us pleasure great to be here awesome so let's kick this off with Andrew uh Andrew maybe let's kind of lay the ground and uh first of all uh you know maybe you can introduce tidark and while you're doing that uh explain what is vertical SAS just to make sure we're all align and why has tidark uh been investing in vertical SAS uh for so long when many VCS historically have shun away from vert vertical SAS because of different misconceptions of maybe a small Tam or niche market fragmented SMB space Etc yeah Happ you too I appreciate the softball questions to to to kick things off here um so tidark a growth Equity Firm we launched about two and a half years ago uh we manage about $600 million of capital invest checks anywhere from 20 to 150 million and our focus is to invest in the next generation of category leaders uh so we're not a vertical SAS only fund it's where I spend the majority of my time uh but we invest in all areas of of of software um uh consumer marketplaces you name it um but the vertical side we've been really lucky to invest in over a dozen great businesses within S&B and vertical SAS uh that have gone on to build dominant Platforms in their respective end markets so think service Titan CCC carbon toast siteminder just to name a few and we're really laser focused on continuing to back those those Future Leaders uh one other note i' I'd call out for tidark uh we have a amazing group of tidark fellows actually ersad is one of of them they're a huge part of who we are as who we are as a firm uh and then another big portion is we're we're not an impact fund but we have an impact component so uh giving back is a big part of what we do and so we have the tide Mark 10 foundation so 10 10% of our profits go go to that Foundation uh to set the stage a little bit um vertical software uh software built for industry um built to the specific needs of of uh kind of the owner operators within a a given Market um and you know the the world really hated SMB and Industry software 10 20 years ago uh the markets are too small they're too fragmented the small acvs can't support you know traditional goto Market but that's that's what people would say um I think what we saw early on within vertical software is that these small business platforms can be incredbly valuable uh that owner operator uh they have incredibly busy schedules and they really want that one vendor to deal to deal with um that single point of accountability to solve all their needs with a tool that's actually built for them and their industry and speaks their language and a result of that is these these tools can go on to build um really dominant positions so get market shares of 40 plus percent versus horizontal players which you know can get up to call it 20% market share and and you look at a a business like viva viva is probably closer to 90 90% maybe close to 100% of uh of the life sciences industry with their core CRM product so um that those are some of the things that we saw and and on the fragmentation piece uh you know it's a it's a feature and a bug I think on the feature side um High fragmentation means smbs have a shot and you know there's higher likelihood of marketplace opportunities and and typically means that there's uh Stronger monetization of payments opportunities as well awesome so Andrew you guys uh as I mentioned earlier encapsulated a lot of those learnings of over you know over a decade of investing in vertical SAS into this vertical SAS knowledge project vskp will refer to it uh can you play can you explain what was kind of the you know the thinking behind putting this project together and in the vskp I think there was a you know as while reading it I felt like a really interesting point was uh the control point so maybe you can explain also what is the control point and why is it important when you start a vertical SAS company to start from one of these control points yeah of course so uh you know we've seen you know nine companies scale to north of 100 million of a on the vertical side five of those have gone surpass the the 500 million AR Mark and I think along the the way um there are a lot of learnings to be had so we wanted to put our heads together and develop a framework uh in the form of the vertical SAS knowledge project to combine our Collective learnings and build case studies to share those with kind of the future generation of of vertical SAS businesses uh and really what it what it does is it highlights how to how to win your category uh by establishing that control Point expand your offerings which is what we're talking a lot about today in terms of going multi product and then extending through the value chain so addressing the other stakeholders whether it be suppliers uh your consumers or your employees um and and that's really what the the vertical stas knowledge project set out to do um a really core part of the vertical SAS knowledge project is this concept of of a control point and I think the simple way to think about it is uh it's it's the last software customer turns off before shutting down for the day or or if you were to wind down your business what's the last piece of software you you'd want to get rid of chances are you're you're control point if if if you um kind of fall into one of those two buckets uh typically there's one in the front office so it touches the customer like a point of sale or CRM uh and one in the back office so something touch is the general ledger and and we talk about them in in terms of um types of gravity uh so there's workflow gravity so uh do you manage the scarce assets of um data gravity so do you hold the most critical information for your customer to run their business uh and you know oftentimes this data can be used to enrich the customer workflow experience as well so the these these are all interrelated Concepts uh account gravity so are are you um solving the needs of the most important user sponsor uh of of the tool um those are probably the most traditional ones but there are other control points that are kind of newer maybe look a little bit different than a traditional system of Records so these could be things like business model innovations that can drive incremental demand so think channel channel managers or you know buy now pay Solutions uh things that can enhance consumer experience like embedded ftech uh being able to offer more efficient and better lending to to your customers uh or an integrate and Surround approach where uh you tap into a legacy system enhance it and over time kind of subsume it over over time awesome yeah I you know I found this uh again the knowledge project uh really uh super interesting and you know we we have had here D to like the entire management go through it and we we set like two hours to go and discuss you know where are we on this journey and it was I really recommend for anyone on this meet on this call uh go go to H tit Mark's website vertical SAS knowledge project and uh I'm sure you'll find this interesting so let let's move on kind of to Jason here uh and hear kind of more of a practical experience Jason uh so Cloud beds what tell us a little bit where did you start what was that first uh product that you launched with and how did you go about thinking of uh you know when is it time to to launch kind of additional project products yeah sure uh happy to so I mean we're we're into our 11th year now is a and for those who don't know we're a a Hospitality platform that lodging businesses use to to uh to run much of their their um daily needs you know we started off 10 years ago uh or almost 11 now as a booking engine um and it really began with this idea that Hospitality has always been and still is today somewhat of a lagard in the technology adoption space you know it's probably right up there with government and healthc Care in terms of the way industry has adopted um technology but uh you know that was very apparent back in 2012 12 and and our Founders Adam and Richard were you know they were Avid Travelers themselves and and identified the the difficulty that existed in trying to book any hotel online through the internet that wasn't a a Marriot or a Hilton or or one of the big chains and realized that there was you know these larger uh the gorillas in the zoo had access to technology that just wasn't available in the SMB space which in hospitality is about 87% of the every property on the planet is actually a small independent hotel or or other type of lodging business so so the booking engine really was the the first opportunity to to give these uh SMB Hospitality businesses the the opportunity to to win some business from from the larger uh from the gorillas in the zoo and and do better themselves um and that very quickly you know translated into a realization that uh the the clear Next Step In the Journey I think Andrew just referred to is is that control point in the business for us it was what's known as the PMS the property management system and that's where uh a hotelier will manage all their reservations check in a guas check out a guest run all of their reports for the day um do all of their reconciliation and and the like and um you know that inside of the office plugged into the booking engine on the outside and became the clear next choices you know to in most cases replace something that the hotelier was already doing in some way or another whether that be with an Excel spreadsheet or using some Legacy technology as mostly existed back then but either way it really established Cloud beds as the as the Central Point inside of the SMB U business um that uh that they used every day and was probably at that point PMS became the the last thing that was switched off to to use Andrew's terminology at the end of the day from there um the the next most important piece was the the distribution piece and the channel management which is in the hospitality space is is what we use to distribute rooms and rates across all of the booking.com and expediasea was being able to help our help our customers again do something that they were already doing but was laborious and time consuming um and giv giving them the tools to uh do that better and be better um save time in doing it uh was the channel manager and uh you know for various reasons the the best approach to that at the time was to acquire uh that piece of technology which you know has been a very foundational piece of our of our business ever since from there we we kind of um moved into this win the category stage um as you can see from from that growth line there to uh we experienced great growth owning that control point in in these three core pillars of the business and we're able to uh to then look at okay so how do we how do we expand our our products here into the next likely opportunity to to create real value for our customers and and that was what we call Pi which is essentially it's price intelligence engine which is essentially a price setting tool and again that was a situation where you know we realized our customers were either not really price setting at all in relation to demand and comp changes in competitive pricing or if they were they were doing it very manually so we we both enabled them to do something that they in many cases had never been doing before or if they had been doing it before Ena them to do it better than they had been doing it before um that uh you know continued on our journey towards um going expanding more into further product lines but then you know deepening into the stack where we where we looked at payments and and websites and again just became this cycle of you know what are our customers doing today or what aren't they doing today that they should be doing that's going to make them better and how do we fulfill those needs so so over time that's uh that's evolved into a product set which uh on the next slide if you uh would have moved forward you'd see really consists of that control point that core offering the property management system and the distribution and booking engine around it which is how our customers acquire their business you can think of it that way the pricing intelligence engine that price setting piece the whistle guest experience which now owns the the poles and wires which which is how our our customers communicate with their guests whether it be via email or text message or Whatsapp um the the fintech offering uh which has streamlined their ability to take payments consolidate more vendors into our platform capture more workflow and make the financial piece easier for them and now most recently with Cloud beds amplify we're getting um very much into the demand generation side of the business for our customers and helping them position themselves and Market themselves in the places that they need to be seen online and that Journey really has been um one of uh you know deepening the value that we're creating for our customers across the things that they're already doing to the things that they aren't doing but should be doing and uh the exciting thing is we still have a long way to go so if you if you move to that next slide there this is really how we think about it you know that we see the the reservations and and distribution uh in the middle of our vertical platform is really being the blood that pumps through the veins of our customers and and that really is the control point that we we control through the PMs and around that we have these three pillars that you know we believe that everything that we do in creating value will either Delight our customers customers the guest uh help them increase revenue and streamline their operations along the way and and as we think about um the product categories that we deliver today and will'll deliver in the future they they really exist around that control point and those three pillars awesome super interesting Jason and uh we'll we'll get back to you in a in a few minutes to kind of understand better how how you make the decision of what are the next products that you're going to build but I I want to take the opportunity to move over to Asad and ashad maybe you can tell us uh you know at service Titan you know what was kind of where you know we know that service Titan is a super successful uh company where where did that journey start what was the first product and how did you go about making those decisions of you know which product are we next going to introduce into the customer base yeah absolutely and thanks for having me and excited excited to be here I think um you know back in the day it's been it's been quite a quite a while ago was around 2015 and around there in vertical SAS a lot of the focus was on you know core users core user pricing um there really wasn't a lot of concept around you know add-on products expansion products there were a few that were doing like mind body with fintech and a few others but the really the concept today which I think tit Mark with Andrew and Dave and team were doing a phenomenal job putting together a Playbook of like what are these vertical SAS companies doing today because back then it just didn't exist and so um it's really like following your customers I think you know you know any other B2B SAS company you just got to understand how can you create the most value for your customer um and within that you know what what type of products and offerings can you actually develop over time traditionally it was you know core users and you may have you know package pricing good better best and you may plug in different products right within each package but then really the idea is that uh it's really a share of wallet approach right so if your customer is spending money elsewhere and you are the system of record I think the key is that right if you're the system of record you're in a really great spot to develop really amazing Solutions so instead of for example a contractor using 10 different softwares using a field service management software but then you know using payments using marketing automation telecommunications there's this ability to actually build uh lightweight products that create actually more value because you can have a better user experience those customers can provide a better experience for their end customers and kind of what this slide is showing is that you know following the money of you know what what your customers are spending money on what software they're spending money on how does that tie to your product how can you create more value to them um that was kind of a key factor in terms of you know building out these ancillary or add-on products um a lot of obvious ones today are fintech products uh just because the you know the value that you can create the more efficiency you can create for your customers and the monetization piece is is pretty awesome too so back in the day um you kind of had to create your own you had to partner with a lot of companies behind the scenes because to build your own you know payment facilitator is quite complicated today's world it's actually pretty awesome just companies like Paya that are authored today which basically are built for vertical SAS companies so you can actually get off the ground very quickly on payments but that was one that um you know whether it's you know toast or service tying or mind body or whatever may be um they're pretty significant business lines for those companies so so yeah fintech was the the first one that we got started with back in the day right and um and so and what was the what what kind was the Evolution from there how how did you make decisions of um you know I'm we're going to build you know product a or we're going to build product B what kind of was the you know the decision- making behind that yeah that's a great question so I think um uh I don't know if I was lucky enough or was in Consulting for a long time but it was 10 years management consulting so I just love Frameworks that's why I love what Andrew and Dave are doing um you know the The Bu build partner approach um just understanding right those opportunities understanding the you know Revenue impact the value to customers you know which ones to do next which ones to experiment with I think some companies um they try to take on too much all at once and they may not be ready for it so getting off the ground you know with one making progress within it and building out your goto Market motion like aligning sales implementation success support operations that's a critical part for the success of these products not just building them but OB obviously just going market so that was a big big component but um essentially is the value part so we start start off with fintech and move to marketing Automation and a few other products and um yeah so uh again it comes back to focusing on your customers and you know what creates most value for them and then what's pretty remarkable and you know part of my thesis is that especially in B2B SAS you know roughly 30 to 50% of your AR one day could be from these ancillary add-on products um kind of depends how you package uh your current you know uh pricing along with ancillary but it could have a meaningful impact and if you structure the the the products the right way it could have a meaningful impact to gross margins as well because a lot of these you don't have to build right if you're you don't have to become a fintech uh company you can partner with a fintech company you don't have to create your own website company you can partner with Duda so um that's why there's phenomenal companies that are out there today where um you want to be very specific about who you partner with with because you want to make sure that partner also has the same level of service that you provide I think that's a critical Factor where sometimes companies launch a product with a partner they didn't do the proper diligence with a partner they not they may not align with the values of your of the company itself so you know for example when I assessed yeah on the fintech side I probably assessed 30 plus companies and landed with probably you know two to three that I wanted to partner with because you want to align with the right one and then have that as a long-term relationship Sometimes some companies partner of the payments company then move to another one then move to another one and another one and then you have you know four Partners behind the scenes processing payments and it gets pretty complex and convoluted so making sure you do the diligence upfront about who you partner with that could power an add-on product is a is a critical Factor as well obviously you should always consider acquisition um and all these factors as well yeah absolutely like we we see it as well right every every company that partners with Duda it's it's a extremely strategic decision right uh they're going to White Label Duda and offer uh as one of their products from the from their customers's perspective there's no difference between the website uh product that is powered by us or any of the other uh products that they're offering so you need to have a huge amount of trust in that vendor that you're going uh you're go you're you're choosing to integrate into your platform and in most cases this is the right the CPO the vpa product kind of decision right to to own this type of relationship as it's so core to the platform yeah J Jason maybe tell us uh right you guys have done a couple of Acquisitions you've built your own products H how do you decide between uh build partner buy well when when ersad mentioned uh Frameworks there I I had a little smile I'm also a lover of of Frameworks I think they uh they they really encourage clear and comprehensive thinking and so you know we have a a framework we call our plat form decision Matrix that we use to decide as we you know as we identify you know what might be the next category um that is an interesting product for for our our customer set as we look at it and we look at the build by uh partner question um you know we we rank it across various uh opportunity criteria one is competitive differentiation how much competitive differentiation will we get out of this particular product that we're thinking about here um is the this part of our core competency as a business already um to be able to do something like this how mature is this product or this category in in the marketplace is it something that's emerging today or is it something that is you know has been around for quite some time and is a lot of the Innovation work has already been done in the category um how defensible will it be and how long will it take to get there and how does it affect our competitive positioning um and then of course things like you know what's the capital cost of each particular option is Al always a a big question mark and and then there's the execution or or vendor risk um with with each approach as well so you know we kind of rank across all of those uh all of those various criteria and it helps us understand you know is this something that we should go and and buy is time to Market important is if we acquire this does it bring us competitive differentiation quickly uh if it's not a core competency of ours that we already have internally is does acquiring it make sense to get that core competency quickly um they're just some examples of of how um the question fits into the the framework and um you know depending on whether or not you're looking at a partnership or an organic builds there'll be different answers to to each question and we're able to kind of score and and rank that and come out with a conversation at the end of the day that guides us right so if we take for example uh Duda or websites what uh assume you you made the right you made clearly the decision there to partner and not do it yourself maybe shed some light on like what was uh the thinking behind that yeah sure I mean um first of all you know we we didn't see as a a Hospitality software company we didn't see CMS and website development as a necessary an existing or necessary core competency for us at at cloudbeds and we could see that there were already it's fairly mature category where there was already some leaders and some people doing it very very well uh it was very unlikely that we were ever going to do it um better or different to the dudah or or any of duda's competitors um and and therefore you know that was probably the the driving factor in this is a clear partnership approach for us um and you know we also saw that uh there was not a lot of vendor risk as well in this space um because you know there were a number of good options out there and we decided that that doodle was the better of the the good options and we haven't regretted that decision okay that's that's great Asad moving uh back to you uh and you know your love for Frameworks so you've uh you have here like this uh really interesting framework you put together of uh evaluating which uh which products uh potentially to launch their impact their level of effort uh Anton if you can put the slides again uh this one can can you explain a little bit the framework of how how you kind of uh you know navigate between these different opportunities of building different products I'm sure a lot of a lot of the folks here on uh on the skull have ideas and there's different ideas running in the business how do you assess which is the best idea to actually pursue yeah it's a great question uh it's definitely not an easy exercise to determine the priorities um and the impact they make because a lot of it as with software right you don't exactly know what's going to happen you just got to do the best diligence up front but I would say even early in the process like understanding the workflow of like how your customers use your software what do you plan to build and kind of you know differentiate the core versus add-on like what are things that we think is core foundational for the software why would someone sign up for this software and then once you sign up you know attaching these products um you know which wouldn't make sense from a workflow perspective from from your customer the first piece and then when you decide which ones that potentially are add-ons um this framework generally you know helped me pretty pretty well in terms of like obviously you know a lot a lot of the intent is for you know generating more Revenue uh for your customer base expanding ACV um but how does it impact margins how does it impacts net revenue retention um what's the expection of adoption for these products a lot of companies obviously focus and and break up their customers by S&B and Market Enterprise strategic will every single part of the customer segment attached to that product it's usually not the case usually the case where sometimes an add-on is more geared toward Enterprise sometimes it's more geared toward SMB sometimes an add-on can actually really help with retention if you attach payments to a field service management platform generally that can actually really help with retention as well so thinking through the different dimensions is actually an important fact factor I think level of effort is a big one too right so when you partner with a company leverage someone's apis maybe even some of their front ends so you don't to build everything is is quite wonderful so um that's a big piece as well uh again back in the day 10 years ago if you want to be you know a payments company um you had to build your own payments platform you could leverage you know some technologies but it was quite difficult today it's much easier to get off the ground um so yeah there's a lot of factors to consider I think going back to my earlier point you don't want to do a lot of it at once you want to kind of narrow in in a few get it off the ground build up the momentum understand the go to market team um really educate the R&D team of how they build and launch these products and then and then continue release them over time um and you also can't forget about the core which is obviously super important um yeah awesome uh Andrew uh given you know kind of the the current economic environment uh do you see and right with the importance of focus on profitability do you see companies in your portfolio playing it safer doing like less bets right there's uh on on New on launching new products less Acquisitions what what are what are you seeing uh currently in in your portfolio I think in in essence yes I I think um uh it's it's uh important to realize that you as a company you have limited resources and opportunity costs are very real as you think about going multiproduct um you know you see this big prize of you know adding embedded fintech and and multiproduct increasing your Revenue two three four five times but multiproduct at the end of the day is is really hard uh it requires significant investment and it can be really high risk um and there's a really big tradeoff too where if you emphasize going multiproduct sometimes you can uh deemphasize your your core control point and what made you great in the first place where uh we look at it as this tension between do you want to drive arpo or locations right uh and and there's a real trade-off there and so um to kind of layer on like when you should be going multiproduct I think um you want to do it before you see it show up in in the data right your your CS are going to go up your close times are going to increase uh and you want to make sure you get ahead of that so we always advise the companies that we work with to be really granular about Tam and trying to assess that before you even hit that point right like get down to your ICP figure out how much Headroom you have and if you have room to run like it's it's our general Northstar to default to prioritizing locations because you have that unfair right to sell those other Solutions later on cool yeah um super important point right so what what you're basically saying is that if there's an opportunity to like acquire more customers without launching the additional product either going up Market or or down Market a little bit or maybe opening new geographies like you that's that would be your initial recommendation I mean even even just hitting the the core not not even pushing up or down market like you know just just driving that that land grab because we see it time and time again that you can get outside market share right because the point is like if you have that control point you can always add uh you can always add more products later exactly right so there's a less less risk uh super cool um Asad or Jason any any thoughts about do you feel like in the current environment it's it's harder to make more more bets uh versus in the past and like you need to be a little bit play it a little bit safer and really make sure that every bet you make on an on an additional uh product is is really one that is going to work and there's going to be sufficient adoption of that product feel free to go how to go first I think it's a good question um I think it depends on your risk tolerance right so if you build a new product it could end up being 30% of your AR one day and and the conviction behind it I think the the idea is that if you can form a single threaded team around product managers QA and engineers and a good GM around a single solution it could be a small percentage of your overall employee base but if they they can crush a product right for example ramp has done that a bunch of other companies have done that as well um and so that could take you to the next level so it's all about risk tolerance and the dilling should kind of do up front um especially in today's environment I think to your point it's like you want to be a little more maybe risk adverse from the general sense of taking on too much but if it's something that you think is uh going to be a winner um taking a bet on that could take your company to the next level but it is a BET right and I think it's but it's also dedication to it's important if you try to take 20% of a product manager's time and you know half an engineer's time to build something that you think is going to be significant generally that doesn't work well um but if you can have a few folks dedicated to it and be you know fully ingrained and not distracted by other initiatives that that's a that's a big part of success around these products yeah I think that um you know I think whenever we we launch a a new product or or begin development on a new product despite you know the the greatest depths of customer research and confidence that goes behind it it is a it is a capital deployment bet until that monetization is is realized and and that cycle of um you know ideation through to actual monetization of the base through the product um can take quite some time um so you know I think that in today's current environment I mean there's no doubt that uh the the cost of capital has is substantially higher today than it was two years ago um and that's causing everyone to to think more carefully about those bets and and probably want to realize more of those bets paying off before they make um make new bets um so I think it really just depends on on how quickly you can you can execute on that cycle how well you can get it right but I would just caution as well you know we we think about product investment across the you know the three Horizon model and and uh you know it's important to be to be thinking about what is going to be that next differentiating product that is going to to come to Market in two years from today and and be dabbling there and being putting a little bit of capital there that's where you ultimately your Innovation competitive differentiation comes from um and you know despite the the uh the environment today and the the inclination to monetize monetize monetize um it's you know I I would just caution it's still important to be looking forward and and thinking about what um the next you know CH gamechanging product is in two years time for your customer base the other thing I would add as well often often it's um the customers are or your customer base is a point of uh resistance too you know you can only you can only put bring so many products to your customer base in such a period of time it's a lot for them to to to take on and because every time they have to make a buying decision and for a business and uh a buying decision can can often be a a a large decision to make so so that's uh I guess that's kind of how we think about it great I want to uh encourage folks to add questions in the chat I'll we'll be glad to answer any any question questions that come up uh until then uh so kind of follow on question uh H how do you how do you reduce that risk so there's as you said there's uh ultimately a risk with any new product that you launch that adoption might not be there did you find any interesting ways or uh to think about it of how can we test something out or how can we make a you know um try evaluate before we put you know this big teams behind it and you know product team development teams uh is there a way to like reduce that risk a little bit uh any real quick for me is um that's that's a great that's a beauty about B2B SAS if your end customer will talk to you um you basically have all you need right in terms of surveys interviews webinars showing them wiame frames talking about the cost of it will they actually you know adopt this product in the future um and that's what's wonderful about you know SAS in general um if your if your customer if you're high touch with your customer you can learn a lot up front versus if you build a product and launch it maybe in some consumer based product you kind of just don't know what's going to happen but a lot of times if you do enough diligence upfront it does take some effort to do that you're actually can drisk something pretty significantly yeah 100% 100% agree with that I mean the the magic there is in is in your customer base you in in B2B you'll always have some highly engaged customers who you know who who really do view technology and you as their technology vandor is a a source of current and future competitive advantage and they want to see you doing good and helpful things for them creating value having conversations with them um and being able to have real conversations with them is incredibly valuable alongside you know the expected um customer Journey mapping and and surveys that we do understanding the value chain of your customer where the wallet is being spent you know all all of that stuff but when it comes to the actual product development itself you know the the customer is is very much the one holding the keys at the end of the day so so being closely engaged with them I think to 's point highly Dr risks the investment and and I think um making sure you get input from both Business Development and product and and all those decisions that that you end up making um and being really honest about your capabilities and and resources I think points of failure that often happen are when you under resource against a new product initiative allocating you know a fractional FTE from a few different departments isn't going to cut it for a lot of these different categories and so uh I do think that you you want to make sure that if you are going to make the push to go multi product and uh launch something new that you you resource it appropriately yeah that's a super important point so I assume not every product you guys launched was uh a success anything uh you can share of you know something that didn't work out what were the learnings behind it what would you have done differently Arad Jason any of you I mean I'd be happy to say that uh 100% hit rate so far at this point in time but yes I'd be lying um you know every now and then we we we do get it wrong and you know I I think if I reflect on on some of the circumstances where uh us or or we have got it wrong at some point in time it's it has always been a moment in time where you know we've we've had a little bit too much trust in our own judgment and not enough voice of the customer involved um combined with you know I can think of of one product that uh you know we took to Market a little more advanced than rather than taking a more incremental approach to the product um we felt that um because of the value that we believed it would create and it does it did create significant value but it's just a little bit too much for our customer to bite off at that moment in time and get their head around and we just took too much to them um and subsequently by taking a few steps back taking a smaller part of that product to them and having them adopt that get their head around derived value from that we've since been able to continue to grow that product incrementally from from that moment forward Rashad any thoughts on the same question yeah I think um and I totally agree with Jason on this one um you know one example is that you could build an amazing product but then if you don't Implement that product and C get customers on that that's you know that product may not be successful so um having the right team that can upsell and Implement and support that product is is very critical if some some product you launch which is you know super beneficial for the customer but it's very difficult to implement and if you don't have the right team to do that whether you leverage your existing implementation team or have a separate team do it um it may not be successful so some lessons learned on my end is that it's really important to align across all teams very early on sales marketing implementation success and support in terms of roles of responsibilities um and having like a GM you know run these things is super critical um the product manager could be the GM maybe the BD person is the partner about you know driving the add-on product could be the GM but you need a point person that can kind of rally across the organization and make sure that you know all the everything is covered when you're launching and optimizing that product yep absolutely I can also say from uh from our my experience uh is that when when we tried to launch a product and this is after surveys and customers saying we we knew customers were were using other products in this area uh not from us and they were open to trying out our product but I think when the product was further away from the core of what we do so right our core is websites that's kind of the core DNA the further if you think about it as an onion the further away you go uh less customers expect it come from you right so I'll just throw in an you know theoretically like if we were to launch marketing automation or or something or CRM you know there's there's a lot of competitors there and it's further away from websites but when we did launched additional products that were uh closer to the core of websites it could be something that lives on a website you know things like SEO or accessibility or uh things around privacy those were much higher uh we we got much higher adoption rates than when trying so I think you need to grow into it you need to start from where your DNA is what your core of your company does really well and where your customers are expecting you to innovate and slowly kind of expand at least this is what I've seen work for us we we we call that compounding gravity right it's finding other control points that are enhancing that data or workflow uh with around your core and you're really looking for areas with compounding benefits right where 1 plus one equals three four five uh and I think a great example of that is you know if if you have point of sale um turns out it's you can take a commodity product like lending and actually enhance it and deliver a much better experience similar with scheduling and payroll like there are certain products that when stitched together are a step function better than the status quo awesome um okay still waiting if again just reminder if there's any questions uh uh from folks we we'd love to uh we'd love to have our panel here answer them feel free to comment uh in the chat um so Andrew follow on question to you um I you know we're seeing I think due to services today over you know 200 different companies in different verticals crazy verticals that I never belied that there would be software there if it's laundr mats dog breeders uh obviously there's the traditional um you know uh real estate and legal there's in every vertical there's a you know at least a one billion dollar company uh if not a couple that are servicing uh that vertical do you think that there's still an opportunity for for billion- doll companies to to be created uh in in uh in different spaces of vertical SMB uh I I do um I think you know obviously there's a flood of venture dollars uh chasing vertical software um I think a lot of folks have woken up to the fact that as you increase share of wallet and can increase arpus some smaller TS become bigger Tams pretty quickly um but you know I I think at the end of the day like you don't need to be a billion dollar company to build a really durable category leading business I think what is critical when you think about some of those smaller Tams is you just need to make sure you finance the business the right way um it's there are just some some categories that may not support a billion dollar outcome and that's totally okay uh you just got to be mindful of how you capitalize it um and then within some of the larger verticals uh there's still a lot of green space like many Industries have been really slow to turn over over Legacy technology I think agriculture um construction I think is still early Innings uh govtech they're they're plenty of areas where I think we're we're just you know Innings one two or three and and have a lot more opportunity ahead yeah I totally agree with Andrew if I could U pigb on that um just within any construction or the trades in general um like if you think of just that Tam itself U think about you know contractor coming to your home a contractor coming to a building or have a GC building you know something like a procore in that space itself it's it's massive and I think there's going to be many multi-billion dollar software companies in this space um for example like you think about just Roofing in general there's a company called job Nimbus they do Residential Roofing phenomenal field service management company in the commercial service space say you you know Andrew in a building you have a mechanical contractor the property manager had a mechanical cont contract come to that building there's company called buildoffs they focus on Commercial service contractors and it's pretty early in that space in the Tam is massive and and these customers need a lot of software to help them grow and be efficient so even I call it vertical within a vertical right um you could specialize in a vertical and be extremely successful um and that's what's amazing right you're serving these customers where you can specialize and focus and and your attention on them and create a lot more benefit than say a horizontal company that spread themselves in across a vertical so that's why it's so interesting in vertical SAS is that you know even within a vertical itself there's multiple verticals and you can have a very successful company absolutely for example dentists are different than orthodontist and you know every almost every vertical once you start a double click it uh there's sub verticals that could be interesting um cool I see we have a question here from hence uh knap uh Andrew maybe this is best uh answered by you building a new SAS company would you rely on your own money or immedi immediately go out to investors uh I'm gonna give the really unhelpful answer which is it it it depends uh I think a lot of what we just chatted about in terms of um what the size of the opportunity is how heavily vended the market is there are a whole host of factors that that go into it um May maybe to simplify it a little bit I I think you want to be resourced enough to be able to build a great product and make sure that you're delivering a um a product that solves the needs of your your customers and to the extent that uh you need Capital to get off the ground absolutely but then I think how you finance it thereafter is largely dependent on how big the opportunity that you're ultimately going after is I mean you look at Viva I think Viva um you know is a you know 25 billion plus publicly traded business now um I think they burned cumulatively $3 million to to get to where they are today uh and that that was um I think their approach to it was raise enough to be able to deliver on a great product but then focus on efficiency not necessarily A a land grab of customers because at the end of the day even in a market like life sciences where your customer that matter probably are in the hundreds uh you know just really focus on them and and double triple down on multiproduct and sell them more I think their their acvs across their customers are close to like $2 million which is is really remarkable when you think about a vertical SAS vender right Arad what what do you think about that question um yeah in general it's it's really interesting I think uh bootstrapping is always fun uh and seeing how far you can go with it um I've seen a lot of companies bootstrap to a certain you know maybe a couple million and then get a growth Equity um but you know understanding kind of the customer base as Andrew is mentioning and the product fit up front um and the level of effort that takes to build out that product um I think it's a significant factor right like if you're you know entrepreneur engineer or you're a business person you're Partners an engineer you can get a product off the ground pretty quickly nowadays right versus 10 years ago so testing it out testing out with customers getting off the ground without Capital um it also puts you in a better position to get Capital as well so I think it's it's it's definitely a great question but I agree with Andrew it's kind of depends on who you are and and the opportunity yeah Jason any thoughts yeah look I I think the the most important thing there that Andrew um and Asad touched on already is you know just being real about uh what product Market fit looks like and uh how big the the market is and what it's going to take to get to a point where you can demonstrate to a future investor that uh you have achieved product Market fit and now this is a fundable business in order for it to scale and grow if if that's um if that's what you want to do I mean bootstrapping is it depends on your situation bootstrapping of course was always be an ideal scenario to be able to get through product Market fit and and get to scale without having to take an investment that is a very very very r a circumstance and uh you know I think um whatever your personal situation is understanding what it takes to get from where you are today to where you need to be to be able to demonstrate that I have a product here that matters and is creating meaningful value for this vertical and it's something that is worth taking bigger uh however you need to do that I think you just need to figure that out and if investment is required then go get investment right absolutely I think uh right there's some uh I think first of all it's good like bootstrapping or at least the getting the first few customers uh yourself uh get you know the your own confidence around uh that the the opportunity is really there before uh taking money from uh investors and I think especially in vertical SAS right we're talking about Niche markets many times I assume the the founders have experience in in this in this Niche and have felt the the pain themselves so kind of for the Founders and the that initial team to go get the the first couple of customers and prove it out is a little bit expected great I think we're nearing here the the the end uh let's see if we have time uh let's see what is uh BR Brendan Quinn's question you've talked about having uh a GM how do you think about p&l responsibility for a multi-product portfolio where who does that sit with oh great great question any anyone want to take that oh that's a good one Bron um it again it really depends in in my view I think it's uh very important to have a a GM or as we we refer to them as program directors um who are sitting in the middle and really they're the champion of of the product is is how we think about them um to the extent that you give them full p&l responsibility there's pros and there's cons to to doing that um but I think what is important um depending on the situation is that they do have clear Milestones of what success looks like and what that timeline of Milestones looks like so they can drive themselves and the team towards that and if that means p&l full full p&l responsibility then uh that can work for some businesses we we choose to to not do that and give them more uh simple granular um but well aligned milestone to to work towards cool I I'll take one more question before we need a roll out uh Michael is asking here and Arad I'm gonna uh give this one to you because I think you were you were the one that were talking about fintech and adding uh Payment Solutions what are some recent patter patterns in fintech add-ons what's possible now that was harder a few years ago yeah definitely great question Michael U yeah credit cards checks a you in today's world there's a lot of other um software companies that support vertical SAS companies um so that's that's one for sure embedded Finance I think Andrew mentioned that there's a lot of embedded finance companies that are very sophisticated have great business models as well so credit cards checks and and financing is U those three are are in particular really great uh for vertical stat right now great well we uh this has been super interesting unfortunately we uh have to to end as uh we're starting uh the next session so I want to first uh thank our panelists here Shaw Jason Andrew this it's been great talking to you guys thanks for having us really enjoyed it's a lot of fun okay than so much thank you and as uh we roll over to the next session uh we're gonna have uh James Wilton from monate join us and talk about pricing and packaging strategies so uh James without uh you know uh let's let's uh let me introduce you here um you know you and I had a chance to to walk to work with each other quite a bit uh but folks here on the call might not know you James has spent the last 10 years helping fast growing companies uh monetize their products he has deep expertise in areas of pricing strategy across Industries and specializes in Tech and cess pricing and in monetization of new products Innovations and startup business James is currently the founder and managing partner of monave prior to that he was a senior expert at McKenzie and Company and led the pricing service line called fuel McKenzie's practice for servicing fast growing tech companies James thanks for joining us thank you it's great to be here yeah so you know this is going to be a the structure here is going to be a little bit different you're gonna you you're going to present uh part of your learnings and thoughts doing pricing in uh and packaging strategies over the years so I'll just hand it over to you and uh you can take it from there fantastic well thank you I we very uh very happy to be here to talk about this topic today it's actually it's a it's a topic that's very close to my heart I mean really because I have as Tai said I've really dedicated my career the last 10 to 12 years specifically on this area and it's all about capturing value right it's really what I think the pricing strategy is capturing value and I think that's particularly important when you have have vertical SAS product because you're you're consciously focusing in on a specific space constraining yourself you have the opportunity to create more value for that space than perhaps a more General General provider would do that makes it doubly important then that you know the techniques to be able to go and actually capture the uh the value that you are you are creating so strategic pricing I think my experience of working in pricing over the years that everybody is very clear on the fact that strategic pricing is incredibly helpful for boosting eidar and boosting your your profit margins we've all heard the power of the of the 1% which says that if you raise all these different levers by by 1% pricing is the one that gives you the biggest bang for for your buck because all of that drops down to the the bottom line I think what is probably less well understood is actually how effective pricing strategy is at boosting the top line as well I we found through our experience at at monov eight that startups and growing SAS companies who to uh focus on changing their their pricing strategies frequently can get a 10 to 15% bump on their their annual revenue growth rate so really if what you're thinking about is is valuation and multiples you're going to get the direct benefit of that but you're also probably going to get an increase in in multiple from Simply growing faster as well it's been a very powerful lever for for unlocking that so that's why I think we would all look at pricing but let's talk about what what pricing is as well and I say as I said when we open this this session here I would think of pricing is about capturing value that's fundamentally what it is it's helping you capture your your F value so you have your your own solution the idea is that you've produced this value added product which is going to going to deliver a ton of value for your for your customers and then the goal of your pricing strategy should be to help you capture a fair portion of value of that that value um and I say fair portion here the word fair is important it's not that we're trying to capture all of the value like the customer should share in that they should get they should get a portion too but you should be getting the portion of that value that you would that you would want to get and unfortunately as with many things uh doing that is a lot more difficult than it sounds because it's very easy to leak value throughout the throughout the value capture process I think that's a good way of starting off just to explain that and to to level set here what what the challenges I would suggest to you that for your product for any particular customer who's buying it you delivering a certain amount of actual value right and you you may be able to measure that you may not be able to but there definitely is that value it is real and it is it is there however I mean the first big challenge with strategic pricing is that when it comes to pricing actual value doesn't actually matter that much what really does matter is perceived value which is the amount of value that the customer can see and it's very common that customers don't see all the value that we that we create that's usually because of messaging right maybe it's that we've thought about the value that we think that they should get from our product and the things that should be important and we're messaging that rather than the things that they actually want to hear about so immediately you you're you're restricting that it might be that we know what kind of value the customers are getting from it but we haven't been able to quantify it so we're leaving that up to their their imaginations which may not be accurate I have actually worked with custo with uh clients as well who actually don't actually know how the customers get value from their from their product they just know they must be getting something and they're kind of afraid to go and poke poke at the answer for for fear of rocking the boat but for all these reasons there's a very good chance that the perceived value the customer is seeing is not that full value so right out of the gate you've restricted the amount of value that you could potentially cast capture from your from your customers the next concept we should all be aware of within pricing is willingness to pay and I'm sure that's something that you all have heard of before it just literally means what a customer is willing to pay uh and there are people who tell you that willingness to pay and perceive value are the same thing and they're not right there is willingness to pay and perceived value are very related if perceived value goes up there's a good chance that willingness to pay will go up as well but willingness to pay is always lower than perceived value that's for several different reasons say firstly there is always an Roi expectation in any transaction that we're doing not just Financial right I mean if you're going to give somebody $10 you're not going to expect that you're going to get $10 back in a year's time you're going to expect a return on that on that investment and that's always that's true with making product purchases as well customers are always going to expect to get more more value than they than they would actually explicitly pay for there are sometimes expectations of fairness sometimes I might think the value is there but I just don't think it's fair that you are charging that that much for it so I won't do it it's all the the psychological aspects of pricing comparables are really important like you might be able to quite happily sell your product for $1,000 a month uh for a long time while while you're the only product in town but then if another product comes along in your in your space and they're say charging $200 for their product per month even if they have got significantly less value than than you the mere fact that they're there is going to affect how much people are going to pay for your product because them being there is going to change the at least potentially change the uh the fair trade of price to Value within your Market uh and budget affect affects it as well we sometimes think that budget shouldn't affect it we think that if the value is there people should pay for it but in the real world there are constraints around how you have to use capital in your operating expenses some things are more critical part than others so just because somebody believes that something is worth it doesn't mean that they'll actually be able to free up the cash to be able to buy it and that's going to bring down the willingness to pay so again willingness to pay is less than perceived value so we've lost a little bit more more value with pricing our goal if we're doing value based pricing would be to set a Target price to that willingness to pay for our customers but that's quite difficult as well because we don't know what the willingness to pay of all of our customers are they don't they don't necessarily want us to know that they would rather that we we underestimated their willingness to pay so we priced lower and they ended up getting uh getting a better deal um and also it's not the case that within your markets that you're serving that all your customers have exactly the same willing us to pay if for buying the same product many of them may have something completely different so if you were going to set a price for each one of your customers at their willingness to pay you would have to have a system that allows you to charge differently across all those customers based on their willingness to pay practically that is incredibly difficult to do there are some markets where you can do that but it is very time consuming it's very cumbersome and so most of the time we're not charging for Unique customers we're charging it segments and so for all the segments all the customers within the segment you're actually selling to the price you end up charging is going to be lower than the average willingness to pay for that for that segment so again we lose value there and then we don't even get that in the final in the final sale because usually with our products there is some form of sales motion where there's a sales motion there is a negotiation and there will probably be discounting and some of that Target price is probably going to get discounted away before we get to the final trans transaction so the image I want to leave you here with is that within this space we generally create a huge amount of value for our for our customers and we end up just capturing a relatively small amount of it because it is so easy to leak value across all of this and really the goal of pricing strategy should be to plug all those leaks as much as possible and raise that amount of value that you can that you can capture uh and I think in terms of ways to do that honestly we could talk for several hours about it but we we don't have several hours we have we have one or what's remaining of one so rather than go through everything what I like to talk with you is three specific topics that I think can be really helpful in capturing more value the first one is price structure so thinking about how you can use your packaging and your price metric to help you price differentiate and capture more value from your customer base second one is price levels here so how do you how do you set the right price levels and how do you get the information to help you set them and then finally price execution so this is really how do you prevent unwanted discounting and stop yourself leaking or of that value that you've created having got to a good a good overall price pricing strategy all right well let's dip into these one by one then let's go into the price structure there's a concept that we should tea up right off the bat here which is price differentiation and uh I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this is probably the most important single Concept in all the pricing strategy um and price differentiation is exactly what it sounds like it's it's setting different prices for different customers based on their willingness to pay it sometimes gets called price discrimination I tend to not use that word because discrimination the word has a negative con connotation and sometimes people think that you can't price discriminate you absolutely can most of the time there are protected criteria and groups when you can't do it but for most of the reasons why any ethical SAS company would want to do it you absolutely can price price differentiate and should in fact yeah so it means charging different prices to different customers and if you can do that it has massive benefits for you because firstly it means you can widen your T at the moment if you're pricing say with one price point you're only going to be able to get all of the customers whose willingness to pay is higher than that that price point but there may be price points you could charge which would still be profitable for you and would be above the willingness to pay of some other customers so if you can do that you can profitably add extra extra customers which allow you to increase your Tam without decreasing the amount of revenue and profit that you're getting from the other customers that you are you're currently serving also if you can price differentiate as well you can charge more to your customers who are less price sensitive and that means you get extra Revenue extra profit from those customers who can who can potentially pay more and this can have a massive impact in your ebit D and revenue there's an absolute ton of case studies that show companies who've done this uh successfully but I think probably the most clear one I can say is that uh case study from my own past there was a subscription Box Company who just had one offering you can buy the box or you can not buy it they decided to add a premium tier to this and they ended up increasing their recurring Revenue through 30% through doing that just through adding a premium a premium tier because they can now start charging more to those customers who can who can pay more now of course it's not just as easy as like let's just charge different prices to different C customers you usually need a structure to do that so I think now let's let's switch and talk about what is the way that we can do that and make those different pricing uh levels work the way that you do that is through what we' call your your price structure and there are two components that we're going to talk through today the first one is packaging again I'm sure you all have heard of packaging just basically means I'm going to create different options or different variants of my of my product with different levels of value and I'm going to charge different prices for them andow customers to self- select which package they they purchase that's called second degree price differentiation the other way we're going to talk about as well the other component and you can use these two together is price metrics and this basically means I'm going to set my price based on a specific scalable quantity so if you need more of this particular quantity or you have more of them in some cases you will end up paying more course the obvious example Le here evidence by the um by the graphic here is seats that's the classic SAS metric but it is far from the only one and we'll talk a little bit about that as we we get into this this presentation but let's start with packaging now there are many different styles of packaging I thinking there's a you could have a whole conversation about that it's probably for another day but there's lots of different ways that you can potentially package your your products I think the most ubiquitous one within the SAS space for good reason uh is good better best I'm sure that's again term that you guys have all come come across it is very very common you see it a lot and that's because it is it is simple it's very straightforward everybody can understand the good better best it's also quite simple for to design for companies if they haven't got a lot of experience with with pricing strategies and building different different packages and it also has benefits that align with the objectives of a lot of smaller growing companies right which is to be able to acquire new customers quickly quickly which you can do through having a uh a low price entry version and then also simple choices that help you help you weigh up a few options and make you feel better about making making a choice then it also has a very clear upsell path to take you up to higher price levels as well so if you are a company that has this land and expand type uh objective a good better best designed well can really really help with that so the benefits are clear um that said it's not as simple as saying let's now just create three three packages randomly and we'll start doing this and we'll um we'll end up getting a good a good result from that you still do have to put thought into what those good better and best packages look like and make sure that it it all the Dynamics around that work for you and make it make it effective um and through working in this space for for quite a long time now around about 10 to 12 years I see four pitfalls that companies frequent ly fall into when they're trying to build a good better best pricing strategy the first one here is too much base uh and this honestly without pointing fingers and uh obviously um generalizing quite quite seriously this often happens if the product function is owning pricing uh product leaders tend to be very passionate about their products and rightfully so but what often comes with that is a uh a concern about taking features away from customers they have trouble sort of living with the idea of any of their customers not having all of the product all of the features that make their their product special so the result of that can be that there's too much value in that base package what that means then is that that base package becomes incredibly compelling for the price point and therefore the how compelling moving up to the the better version is decreases con considerably so you end up with a lot more customers than you would like like on your entry version and you have the land point part figured out but you struggle with the expand part so obviously fix there is to sometimes you have to be a little bit ruthless and take things out out out of the base really just solve for the minimum viable product that your most price sensitive customers are going to be are going to be happy with no more than that the second one here is uh called pitching to the middle uh one of the benefits of good or better best or actually more than the benefits one of the one of the um the features of good better best I should say is that a lot of the times you end up with a large portion of your customers purchasing the middle package and it is partially a benefit right because when you're evaluating the different options if there's a middle version a customer who's unsure about what they want can say well I don't want to buy the cheapest one and I probably don't want everything so the middle version is probably right we call that goldilux pricing a lot right because it's not too big it's not too small it's just it's just right but there's a real difference between accepting that that will probably happen and forcing it or encouraging that that to happen and you sometimes see SAS companies basically play around with price levels of the different versions to make the value proposition for the middle version way more attractive than either of the other two so you end up with a lot of customers in that middle version but then you get a lot of customers who perhaps would have bought the base if you priced it properly will no longer buy it so you lose potential customers there and also there's probably a lot of customers who perhaps would have up sold to a higher version had it been priced effectively you will now be stuck in that middle version so you haven't created a disaster but you've lost a lot of potential by just forcing this this Goldilocks approach rather than letting letting the chips fall to the right um to the right Right Packages the third one here we call the Grand Canyon uh and it me's really having a lot of space between your packages uh the best way I can describe this is to give an example I once worked with a with a C client who had four packages the first package was priced at $15 per per month the next one was priced at $150 per month the next one was priced at $1,500 per month and the last one was priced at $115,000 per month now one of the big benefits of packaging is to give customers a choice and allow them to select right and no customer is going to come in here and say do I want the $15 a month version or do I want the $155,000 a month version right those are going to be very very different different um packages and they're really ta tailored for completely different different buyers different sizes so the right fix for that is to you're having your packaging do too much in that in that situation you're trying to differentiate across size of customer in addition to just giving giving um features and functionality differentiators you would be better off setting the price levels of those packages closer together and then allowing a price metric to scale the price price Up and Down based on something that aligns to the uh to the um uh to the the wills to pay and then the last one here is too many sources of difference I'm sure you are all very familiar with those uh classic SAS pricing pages when you have your your different packages then you have a a laundry list of features with check marks next to all of them to show what's what's included sometimes these lists can get incredibly long and you can get to 50 to hundreds of of features for a customer that can get incredibly confusing so if I don't know what is important and what I should be focused on then there's just too many things to look at as I'm crossing over from one from one package to to the other one ends up muddling the choice and making them less likely to buy you are far better for communicating your packages is just focusing on a couple of features or capabilities that are really a aligned with the value that the customer gets and B aligns well with the philosophy of how you're you're gating and and positioning your your your packages is and just letting them focus on on on that it creates the whole thing a lot more um a lot a lot more seamless James maybe we take a there's a good question here coming from uh H good better what what would you go for a good better best type of packaging or introduce just one basic plan and then charge for extras like add-ons I assume the the extras question well we'll actually get into that in a little bit actually we can sort of talk about certain features and capabilities should really be part of Premium packages or or part of add-ons so we will go and answer that um that differently but um I would say Hans it's um it it's it's somewhat dependent on the amount of features and capabilities that you're working with and their and their um their profile right if you have it is another it it depends if you uh if you have if you have enough features to be able to to differentiate and actually create three compelling packages packages for different use cases or different situations and I would say a good better best is better than having one base and having a lot of different individual add-ons but not every product is going to have the breadth of capabilities yet to be able to do that and also sometimes if these individual features are more Niche they're more things which some customers are going to want and some other customers aren't then you're better monetizing them through that addon add-on structure than you would be through the uh through the tiers cool so I keep moving on it anymore let's go let's move on and if there's questions people should feel free to ask exactly and this is how you start to Classic that you'd be able to answer some of these these questions actually through this analysis right here which we would call a feature evaluation grid so when you're thinking about how would I construct these tiers well how do I decide what goes in base versus premiums versus add-ons the best way we are found to do that is to be able to go to your customers do some light research and just ask them to categorize these features for you you have to explain the features so they understand what they they're reacting to but with each feature go and ask them what um how valuable is each one of these features would you consider this particular feature something which is not valuable is it something which is kind of a nice to have is it something which is essential and you would consider it you consider it table Stakes for any product in this in this space they have for it to be useful to you is it something which is differentiated right which means this is something which if it didn't come a standard within a product I'd potentially be willing to pay more for in order to to get it or is it something that's more than you need now if you take that frame there are two answers there that correspond to this is a valuable feature and it's the this is a table Stakes thing that I need to have and it's the differentiated this is something I would pay more for so in this chart here everything falls into a 2 by two in Consulting the x-axis here is the percent of customers who find the feature valuable and then the y- axis here is going to say of those customers who thought it was valuable what percentage of them said that they would pay more for it so if you do the analysis that way then the bottom right category here becomes your core features these are things which lots of customers consider to be valuable but not many of them would be willing to pay extra in order to get so those are really the things that you would need to have within your within your base package to make it make it compelling now the top right these are features which a lot of customers uh find find valuable and a lot of those who find it valuable would be willing to pay extra for so features in that general area are going to be really great features to put into a higher tier because lots of customers will want them together and lots of customers will pay extra in order to get that so that kind of makes it uh ideal for that better and and best package that you could be could be constructing now the top left here this is where we get to the add-ons so anything top left there's not that many customers who find them valuable but those customers who do find them valuable would be willing to pay extra in order to get them and for those features if you put them into your tiering you're going to end up having to discount them pretty heavily because most customers aren't going to Value them and aren't going to want to implicitly pay for those for those features so you're actually better off in that situation to break them outside of your tears charge them appropriately based on the value that they're going to be providing to those few customers who do find them valuable and allow them to just opt in or opt out that's when those those addons um those extras would come in as hans's called it and then the bottom left here is the final quadrant we call this ancillary because they're really they're features which people don't consider to be valuable and they wouldn't want to pay extra for so oftentimes these can be features that you know this is a new feature that you were betting on this information might give you uh give you pause for thought and think about maybe this is not worth the the investment if it's something you already have and is fundamental to what you do it's just something you would stop talking about with the customers right they're there they exist but you don't want to muddy your value proposition me messaging by telling the customers about these features because they don't they don't care about them James so question here on the for my side on this uh Niche category so if you have this certain feature that you know not enough of the customers are there's a certain segment of customers that are willing to pay for it it's not it's not a lot and those who are willing to pay for it are willing to pay quite a bit so how how do you decide if this is an add-on or maybe this is that that last package on the right that yeah I think there's I think there's an analysis there ital that says if you've got a few few of those features when there's not that many people who want them but they be willing to pay extra for are the customers who want to pay extra for all these features the same customers right like if it's if they if it's a small segment of customers it's only 20% but it's the same 20% who value these these features then that means you could probably put it in this as that premium tier right knowing that that particular 20% are always going to go and go up and and buy that thing if it's a different set of customers who value those those three things you'd be better off separating them out because it's unlikely that the um the customers who are buying it are going to want to pay for everything there they'd rather just pick pick one one thing makes sense yep all right that is packaging um so I think let's move on and talk about price metrics here the other component of price structure which is really important uh I mean in my opinion one of the most exciting uh aspects of of SAS and SAS pricing really is the freedom now that we have to be able to pick our unit of of monetization you know back in the old software days you were really constrained to licenses because you were installing them on in individual desktops and now we really do have the freedom to be able to price on pretty much anything as long as it makes sense and we have the uh the operational capabilities to do do it and it means now that there are it's there's almost an infinite number of options you could potentially charge based on so now we don't even ad monate we don't even keep like a log of these are all the different price metrics you could choose from we tend to think about categories so the categories we would consider would be user based so this is the one that's closest to that traditional seat or license based model seats would be in there active users would be in there endpoints devices anything that kind of corresponds to how many people are actually using using the product then there's usage based which is really is having a having a kind of a Resurgence at the moment there's a lot of usage based pricing happening and I think that has really gone along with uh the increased adoption of of AI and just generally the value of products being more driven by how customers are using them rather than how many individual users are using them but there you're thinking about things like API calls number of tests number of downloads number of sessions anything that really corresponds to the users how they're how they're using the product similar but different is capacity based metrics so these are usually it's usage it's it's usage align but it's usually placing a restriction on that so giving access to a number of gigabytes of storage or Ram or number of CES or something that you can that you can uh put a constraint on allow people to use up to that the next one business-based this is actually one that gets forgotten about a lot in B2B pricing but this is essentially saying if price metric pick a characteristic a scalable characteristic of the companies that you are that you are selling to so it could be maybe will set price for you based on your revenue or set price for you based on your number of employees or the number of customers or the amount of spend within a particular area really theoretically anything is potentially up for grabs there that that would correspond to the value that you are you are providing them and then the last one here is very interesting I think because theoretically it is the best way of doing it but practically you see it used very rarely which is output based and it's saying I'm going to set price for you based on a metric which corresponds to how much output you actually get from my product so if I have a product that ultimately is going to help you generate more revenues I might set price for you based on how much revenue is actually generated so theoretically it's great because it produ it's completely value aligned it's very clear practically it doesn't happen because there's complexities in setting that uh if you are sort of Mo increasing a particular metric there's the question about how much are you doing versus how much is being done by other operations that may be happening within my business so attribution can become a little bit difficult you have to Baseline it and measure uh performance above that which can get complicated and also if you're a growing vendor if you're going to be charging based on the output of something that usually involves waiting a certain amount of time for that output to be real realized which means you need to delay your payment by by a certain extent which for many smaller growing companies is just not viable and uh I think that's why I see this most frequently usually in larger companies who are launching new product lines and they have the capital to be able to wait to get the uh to get the Returns on on that do you have a question time yeah uh what what do you see in the current economy with uh you know is there a is there a kind of a model that M you know a lot of these models worked really well in the last decade when things were only up and to the right right employ employee bases were growing usage was growing now with h companies kind of downsizing uh you know shutting down project or less employees some of these models are are also you know hurting vendors so is there like uh how do you think about that that component yeah absolutely yeah so I think it so it comes into the criteria you think for metric which we which we will get into um on the next page right but I think it's there's it means sometimes when you're when you're monetizing your product and you're picking a unit a unit of monetization it's really important you pick something which is generally going to be growth aligned we call it right something that is going to go up rather than go than go down and I think in some Industries where there's a lot of products that are based on headcounts and you know number of employees or number of seats and things number of employees in economic downtown turns companies tend to downsize so immediately the size of that metric is going to is going to drop um also number of seats usually seats is completely discretionary I can choose to have as many or few as I want so it makes it very easy for me to take them away so generally in those situations with with downturns you see companies switching to things which are a little more stable in in those um in those in those periods the things that are not kind of as um susceptible to being changed by the by um the pull of of the of the economy either doing that or changing the architecture around their pricing so that maybe the number of units goes down but maybe the the price level reduction you get through decreasing that number of units isn't you know the same magnitude as the actual reduction sort of having banding and sliding scales can help with with that makes sense and uh just to answer I see H has a question more to me where does Duda fit in this so I think for the Grand majority of our customers we are probably on the usage based right it's a per site per per month or per site per year um I think in in some in some cases to our you know more medium and bigger customers there's also this aspect of uh a platform fee that comes with our custom plans with a usage based on on top so with published sites uh on top of that platform fee yeah okay let's continue continue y so then given that we have so much Choice here there's a fair question of well how do we choose between all these different metrics how do we pick something that's going to work for us uh and the answer there is to consider the criteria of a good pricing metric and the first one and the most important of all of them is the value alignment right which basically means if a if a metric is value aligned it means that the customer is going to agree that as this number of metric as this number of units of my metric increases I get more value from your from your product so we use seats as as as an example seats is value aligned if I think I get significant extra value by having one extra person be able to use use the product which is sometimes the case and it is sometimes not not the case but if you can pick a value aligned uh metric then you really get this you get this virtuous cycle it's self reinforcing right you're telling people I am charging I'm charging based on this metric and as this metric increases you get more value so there's a real alignment between your value proposition and your and your monetization which is really the gold standard next criteria we already mentioned this in passing is growth oriented right in general many companies the size and scale we're talking about uh it's very important for them to to to grow revenues and a big part of that is often we want to be able to increase the revenues of each individual customer that we are we are selling to over time so if that's the case if you are monetizing on a particular metric and that metric generally tends to grow over over time then you're in a great position there because you know that you've got a a lever to be able to increase their their um their revenues I think it's really key to really Challenge on this whether it is growth Al line though and make sure that it is growth aligned in all situations because to uh it ties question right sometimes these metrics do go down in in periods of of difficult time and as we'll talk about in the case study a little bit later sometimes these metrics just just naturally go down and you wouldn't necessarily think about it because of the way that your your product is is evolving there are other criteria as well uh so acceptability this is around fairness right it is quite possible usage based pricing gets into this some sometimes where I the customer might agree that the metric is value align but I still don't think it's fair that I should have to pay based on it so you sometimes have those those conflicts and checking that it's fair will make it will be checking that it's seen as Fair will make make a difference controllable and predictable are very similar but controllable is as a customer can I kind of decide how many of these that I have instead of set set a cap predictable is if I'm being if I'm being charged based on something am I going to be able to predict the number of units that I'm going to need and therefore am I going to be able to predict what my what my price is going to be again if you've got something which is um scaling all over the place and it's being used by people and I don't have any control over over that it's not very predict predictable and I could be vulnerable to massive price increases that I've got no no control over and that can be a barrier to adoption for a lot of a lot of companies with strict strict budgets and the last one is auditability and this simply means can I measure and track it objectively right because if you can't then you're really going to be reliant on the customer to to tell you how many of this particular metric they have they want and a that means you got to do the exploration and validation with that which adds friction but also it gives the customers an opportunity to lie and get a lower price point I think that actually happens less than we would we would think about it but it is a it is a possibility so these are all the things you'd want to think about you're doing it let's talk about usage based pricing a little bit as well because as I say that is a trend area that a lot of companies trying to do this right right now and there are many benefits of it right is it's becoming more familiar to customers and more acceptable uh because of its um because of its prevalence uh it is highly scalable you know usage can usually range from very low numbers to incredibly High numbers so it allows you to kind of really get a good spread across all your all your customers and assuming that does align with willingness to pay you can definitely get to a lot of different price points for for different customers usage metrics do tend to grow over time as we've talked about there are situations when they don't but they do in general uh if usage is correl is is correlated to Value then a lot of times usage will go up as customers start getting more and more value from from the product uh and also a lot of usage metrics if you're Cloud hosted they will be um they can be based in on your costs in in the clouds like a lot of the um the metrics that align with what Amazon web services and so forth will will charge for therefore if you're pricing based on that same metric you know that you're covering your your costs which can be important to some of the customers who where those costs are a large portion of their overall cost base however there are a lot of pitfalls as well and I think these are not always so obvious from the outside looking in firstly usage based pricing is not always value B value aligned it's not always the case that value increases as usage goes up and even if it is even if customers agree that in general yes as I use it more I'm getting more value they often will not agree that if I use it twice as much I get twice as much value there's going to be a diminishing return there so you if you're going to do it you have to really think about how that value does change with usage and allow your your pricing architecture to to get to the right price points it's not always growth Orient oriented as we said there are situations when uh when usage can can can drop off over over time which means you can be vulnerable to to down cells it can often not be predictable so a lot of these a lot of these usage metrics particularly if they're kind of end consumer metrics so if I'm a if I'm a customer buying a product if the usage is how my customers use my product that's what I'm being charged on I have absolutely no control and often no no visibility into that at all so I could be very vulnerable to massive price Springs and that could be that could be tough oftentimes usage based pricing in the way that we think about usage based pricing doesn't count as recurring revenue and that's a key one right because if you are if you're pricing based on usage you're recording usage and then charging for how much usage you had that is not recurring Revenue it might be reoccurring Revenue but that's not going to have the same multiples so that's a consideration as well there are things you can do to fix it which we'll talk about later but it is uh something to think about and lastly usage based uh Transformations if you do not have the infrastructure already to track and measure and do all the things you want to do with it it can be a lot of effort to uh to to implement I will bring out this one very quick case study here on picking a picking a usage based metric this was I was working for a company that um that had a product that had intelligent search capability that you could plug into websites eCommerce sites Etc to be able to help you find what you're what you're looking for they wanted to move to usage based pricing and obviously the the um the metric that jumps to mind is well number of searches right if I'm searching for things I'm getting value so let's charge based on number of searches however there was some complexity there because firstly uh a search is uh is is a keystroke in the technical back end of it youve see when you go into Google and you start you start touching if you're searching for Bear if you type B it starts bringing up a list of options for B when you type be it brings up another list of options each one of those is technically a search so if we're just using our technical def definition that's not value based because the customer wasn't searching for those individual components they only want the final the final answer there's also an issue that as their search algorithm improved you might expect that they would need fewer few searches or fewer iterations of the searches to find what they were looking for right you know that when you've gone into a search engine you try something you don't find what you want so you try something slightly different so again as they got better of thinking about what customers are actually looking for they might expect their number of searches to go down which is not what they wanted so uh many iterations uh and conversations later we all ultimately stacked hand on a metric which is unique searches which is basically a new metric that was created saying it is any searching within a certain time period regardless of keystrokes or how many in individual searches that counts as one search so if I'm there and I'm searching for about two minutes and then I stop that would be one search session and that is then a Val value aligned and that will go up as people start to use the product more so it controls for the things that work we trying to solve for final Point here think about your architecture around around your metric if you're trying to solve for um acceptability and and predictability you can put caps in place to say that whatever your usage gets to it's not going to be any higher than this that can give some kind of certainty you can put bands so as long as you know roughly where you're going to be in terms of usage your price level is not going to change that can help with it as well or sliding scales right you start to rapidly decrease the amount that your price increases as you get up to higher levels of usage so yes your usage may get significantly higher but you're not going to be paying that much more for it all of that can help you manage that and lastly I would say controlling for this AR thing the real unlock here is to move from this kind of transactional usage based pricing to more of a usage based subscription as it's generally being called which basically means rather than charging in Aras for the amount of usage that you did you will set a subscription price for a certain capacity of usage that you expect your customers to stay under and charge them a flat price per month for that level of usage don't let them don't let them down sell within the within the term of their of their sub subscription and at that point it is recurring Revenue because it's predictable it happens it doesn't change until um until renewal just like a a user based subscription would you can then still start making choices about whether if they do exceed their usage within that period do you start to charge them overages do you give them options to upsell to different tiers within that you you can build all of that into it but I think that's really a way of getting the benefits of usage based pricing and keeping the benefits of a more classic uh subscription all right that's all on price structure and those the biggest section so let's quickly go through uh through price levels and price execution here to give you those thoughts price levels really helpful to think about price levels right I think it's usually if you're thinking about changing your price levels most of the time it's because you suspect your pricing might be too low and there are a number of signs that could indicate that would that would be the case generally if your customers are not complaining about your prices or they're saying how great uh the value for money of your product is good indication that you can increase increase your uh your prices your customers shouldn't be delighted with your with your pricing they should be content so if you're hearing that definitely suggest that you can you can increase not a guarantee but if your churn didn't increase the last time that you you put through a price increased suggest that there may be Headroom there you have to be a little bit careful of that because if you have a product where there's not an obvious alternative customers might feel trapped it might be the case that they feel forced to pay the price increase but they're very unhappy about it and they'll be looking for for other other options so keeping an eye on customer satisfaction at the same time as looking at that is really important if your win rate is really high right if you're kind of hearing we never lose a deal on price that probably means that you're discounted a bunch to be able to win to win the deals really if you've got a good product and you are you are you are differentiated you should be willing to walk away from a certain number of deals based on based on price right if they haven't got the willingness to pay for your product you should let some of those customers go if your sales reps aren't asking for discounts you almost certainly can increase your your prices sales people are very quick to ask for discounts as we will talk about later they're not asking for it you can probably increase also just from a value perspective if you feel that your competitors are weaker than you and they are charging the same prices as you or you've got custom you've got competitors who are about the same value as you who are charging more then it almost certainly means that you can charge more and should because if you keep pricing at the level you're pricing then what's probably going to happen is everybody is going to decrease their prices and you're going to end up having to decrease your prices again if you want to keep that same positioning which just sucks value out out of the market so nobody wins in that in that scenario so when you do find your prices are too low then you obviously want to find out what your prices should be so you look at techniques for getting to willingness to pay to try to help you understand that and there's lots of different ways of of doing this I certainly won't go through all of them today uh and they all have different pros and and cons uh I would say two that we'll focus on today are firstly the van westendorp technique which I think is a a really good way of just getting a good sense of the range of viable prices for specific customers and it's quite easy to do that across a range of customer sizes as well so we found it very useful for that and also doing a value proposition map which is very helpful if you're in in in a uh very competitive space and you want to be setting your price relative to your value differential versus your your your competition so ban Western do technique it's a research technique that really relies on the idea that there isn't like one specific price that works for a customer there's a range of viable prices and there's going to be different uh different probability of them buying within that range so rather than asking a respondent or customer what would you pay for this particular product you ask them to Define four levels for you tell me what price you'd consider this to be inexpensive good bargain what price would you consider this to be getting expensive but you'd still you still consider it what price would it be too expensive to even consider and now also tell me at what price would it be so cheap that you question the value that the product actually provides if you can do that you can think about different relative purchasing probabilities um for prices that fall outside of these ranges for customers so there's no chance of them buying it above two to to expensive or below so so cheap you probably maximize the chance of them buying it somewhere between inexpensive and and getting it expensive if you can do that then looking across your entire customer segment you can then start figuring out what price level do you maximize volume you're going to have most customers buying it at what price point are you going to maximize revenue and if you're able to have your variable cost plugged into it as well you can also extend that and say what price levels do you you maximize profit so this can be really helpful if you are trying to price to a specific business objective right if I am going to if I'm really looking to maximize my profit here I'm going to price at 490 if I'm at the moment based on my Evolution I'm more interested in just building share then I'm better off at pricing at $150 the next one here as well is um is value the value proposition map or value profiling and the idea here is to be able to understand the value differentiation of your product versus your your competition and set pricing for for that so the way you do this is you tap into all the attributes of a company that a customer might be considering when they were making a um a a vendor decision so you might have things like how easy to use is it how broad is the functionality in this particular area how good is the customer support etc etc and you find out from them how relatively important are these attributes in your decision making and how well do you perceive all the vendors that you have experience with to be performing on each one of these each one of these attributes uh and then you also ask them what is the relative price level of all these vendors from all the quotes that you've you've received so doing that you end up with a map on the left hand side which we don't have time to go through in in too much detail but fundamentally it'll then tell you which of your attributes are competitive advantages for you because they're things that are really important and you're performing really well at versus things that are really important that you're not performing well at and you should focus on but all of this can give you a weighted average value score which we then combined with your relative price level allows you to plot a graph like this on the right hand side here where you're the dark blue dots and all the light blue dots are your are your competitors and you can see what your relative price the value situation is relative to them in this particular case my this this client um receives they provide they are perceived to provide a a lot of a lot of value relative to the price level that they are providing so there is a pricing opportunity to uh to increase there do have a case study here I'm going to skip over it in the interest of time and make sure we we finish up here but we can go into price execution any questions on the price level piece before we go and quickly cover off uh price execution all right yeah nothing on the chat so we can uh continue and get to questions maybe towards the end towards the end perfect all right price execution then so this is how you present how you prevent uh discounting all your products away I think the most important thing to realize here as you're going into this is that you know in smaller growing sass firms we we like our sales teams to be very entrepreneurial I mean that's what we want them to do go out and win and win business uh we don't want to change that that's that's exactly right and they should be applauded for the ones who did that well but you have to remember that if your sales team are compensated as a flat percentage of the AR that they they bring in which they often are in these cases then they are incentivized to Discount as much as they possibly can and that's kind of counterintuitive the sort of the usual response to that is well but if they are if they if they're incentivized based on AR if they sell at a higher price they end up getting more more comp compensation so they are incentivized to do to do more that is true but it doesn't consider their their perceived chance of winning at those different price points salesperson is not necessarily going to be running the math but really they're thinking that their expected payout from every every deal is going to be a function of their perceived chance of winning the deal at the price point they're charging multiplied by their incentive pay out if they win so if you think how that trans lends to a no discount or or 10% discount the incentive they get if they discounted 0% rather than 10 is about 10% higher but usually rightly or wrongly often wrongly in most cases sales people will think that their chance of winning at that higher price point just drops off a cliff it's massively lower so the function of those two things together means that you're expected payout at either one of those price levels it's it's significantly higher when you discount more and that's why if you if you analyze um if you analyze the frequency of discount percentages across Salesforce and I've literally done this probably about 30 times and got exactly the same same result you see charts that look like this and these Peaks here there's lots of discounting at 10% 25% and 35% in this case that's because 10% is the maximum amount that a sales rep can discount on their own 25% was the amount they could discount if their sales first the sales manager approved it and then 35% in this case was sales director or could be SE sea level executive so you can see they always default to going to the maximum level that they possibly can which obviously is not great for you You' much rather if they can get away with pricing at 5% you would much rather that they they do that and the way that we can do that the way that we can stop them discounting more is through three levers this firstly is rules so this is basically putting constraints and stopping salespeople being able to Discount more than you would want them to so part of that can be the approval thresholds but we've already shown that they aren't that effective on on their own another thing that you can do is to Institute rule-based discount levels so you might say to a salesperson you can discount up to 5% with absolutely no justification at all it's fine you can just do that as part of a negotiation with with the customer to show that you have um autonomy to make those those decisions but if you want to Discount beyond that there has to be a certain situation applying or a give get right so it might be if the customer is in a particular segment which is strategic priority for you you can give a 3% discount for for that or if they sign up for a 2-year deal as opposed to a one-year deal you can give 5% for that um sometimes you can get quite creative with this and start thinking about well what about if they give me you know five warm leads to people who are within my target buyer Pro profile that I can send to that might be worth an extra discount as well but in all those cases you're either aligning it to a situation that corresponds to um to either something that you want to incentivize or something that corresponds to a lower willingness to pay or something that is just trading price for Value so in that case you're moving from a situation when you're just giving up price for the hell of it to far far more strategic discounting which is absolutely fine you can also think about incentives as well how do you incentivize salespeople you can kind of make them more incentivized Beyond just that 10% increase we talked about to to price at higher levels so the obvious way of doing that but is often a bit more complicated than we typically want to go to here is obviously you can CH you can incentivize people directly based on their um on their adherence to to pricing levels you can give them um incentives based on their discount percentage or based on their average price level tends to be a little clunky for for growing companies honestly so you think about the other things that you can do that are easier to do that will have similar effects like potentially you keep your price your um incentive SK team based on AR but then you'll have a kicker to their bonus percentage at the end of the year based on your average discount level that they achieved within that period or sometimes I've seen it be effective just simply publishing A ranked lead table of all the sales reps based on their average discount percentages they may not care about being at the top of that lift but they definitely don't want to be at the bottom so it kind of kind of it can create more of a healthy competition to to push them to Discount um less than they would otherwise do so then the last one which gets forgotten about uh is enablers and this is this is basically solving for that perceived chance of winning at those price levels so you want to be able to make sales reps feel more able to win at higher price points to do that that can be partially sharing uh information so if you have done research on customer willingness to pay or research on your value differentiation versus versus competitors share it don't just give them the outputs of it and say we should be pricing higher show them the data that shows that you are better or that customers will pay more they will believe it more and they will feel better about fighting for those higher price points uh giving them value messaging that will help them defend those higher price points so they're not rying on doing it on their own and of course training them on doing value negotiations and being able to um to defend price uh within those conversations that will make them feel more able to win at those higher price points as well all right I think we just got through it in just about the right amount of time but uh summary here I think three things to think about so firstly building an effective price structure think about your good better best packaging how to build it effectively pick the right price metric set price levels using a technique that's going to help you get uh get a good pulse on willingness to pay and what you should be able to charge and then to stop your discounting consider rules incentives and enables awesome James this is uh this has been super interesting and obviously you have a ton of experience here so uh I know we're at the end of the hour but I'll ask a couple of questions and whoever can stay can stay uh folks who want to come back afterwards and see the recording uh the the you will all get a link to this session so so James kind of one of uh one of the things is right we obviously are as as platforms Solutions we're trying to constantly optimize uh and and many times we have a lot of different features and different pricing mechanisms and um uh different tiers and it starts getting pretty complex yep uh you know you look at definitely I think over the years dudas pricing uh has become more more detailed and more complex I look at some very established vendors in the space like sales force or hopspot you know you'd go to their pricing page it's uh you know you need a PhD to really understand uh how how how they price it because they're they're trying to optimize for every single feature and every use case so what's kind of your your sense uh your sense there are are like should we stay away from like do we do we over do we bear the risk of over optimizing our pricing and becoming too difficult or are people who are really interested in our products going to take their time and you know to to really understand it at a very granular level gotta that's a great question um can I get another big it depends flag but it does honestly like so there hope I'll give you a bit more information there right so it does it does depend it depends on different factors right I would say it depends on your objectives and it depends on the the segment that you are that you are selling to right so if you're selling to consumers or an SMB buyer right you're usually selling to somebody who's not a purchasing specialist and who probably strapped for time doesn't have time or the energy to go and evaluate a lots of different things so for that kind of buyer if you are building a pricing strategy which is incredibly complex and multifaceted then you're going to lose them and it's going to make them far more difficult for them to make a to make a decision so you generally want to avoid um more uh more complicated structures in that in that situation likewise right if it's if it's a lower price product and you're maybe doing you know you're you're not having a sale rep involved it's a short sales cycle people could buy directly over over the website for for example that times two the same same situation you want to make it very easy to understand quick to make a decision and and so forth however uh oh sorry in the last thing on that is objectives right also I'd say if a big part of what you're trying to achieve as as a company is to bring on a lot of com a lot of customers quickly then a more complicated uh pricing strategy is going to increase the length of time needed to make that decision and and understand so you're going to decrease your sales velocity so again then you'd want to move to something a bit more a bit more simple however like the opposite side the opposite situations which do occur would push you more towards something that's a bit moreit more complicated right if your if your objectives now you're far more you're more mature you're thinking far more about optimizing revenue or optimizing Pro profitability in that case you generally do want to have a more complicated pricing structure where you have more options and more things because the way you're going to maximize your revenue and your profitability for all your individual customers is you know being quite granular in how you charge them for all the different things that they they might want so providing the the juice is going to be worth worth the squeeze there you would want to have all of those extra extra decisions also you're selling to larger companies Enterprises you're usually dealing with a procurement person who will have the time and the patience to go through everything else and probably wants to actually select from you know lots of different things and get a far more customized plan so theyd actually prefer that than have something which was super PR super um simple where they didn't get that same level of of of control absolutely I think uh you know I kind of think about it as you know pricing is just same as you're you know you're marketing your your product you want people to get like the basic information at a glance and depending where they are in the buyer Journey as they're willing to dig in and spend more time with your product you want to get more granular and more detailed understanding of the pricing and I think this is why you know you see you can see it on duda's pricing page you can see it on a lot of other platforms there's kind of this pricing View at a glance that you can get kind of the main gist of how it's priced and then just below that there's kind of a much more expensive detailed table uh that breaks down the more granular features that might not be relevant for everyone or for again someone who's more uh willing to spend time to understand absolutely yeah exactly and I totally agree with that I think even when you do have something more complex you need to be able to summarize it at a higher level still relatively quickly right I remember building a pricing strategy for a uh it a market research platform which had a lot of services as well and there was a ton of different components here because there's so many different offerings but we had to be able to boil it down to First you pick your tier of your platform then you pick your your your usage tokens and then you choose your services so like that message is relatively simple okay okay I get it but then they go in and they get all the complexity and the details within each one of those individual phases awesome um what do what do you think about AB testing pricing uh is that something that you're in favor is that something you recommend to customers I know some in some cases it's it's difficult to AB test either because there's not enough volume to get statistical significance or it could take a very long time to get um conclusive answers or maybe it's just like very hard to te to test pricing uh because your customers might you know see different prices and things like that yeah absolutely no I am in favor of AB testing in certain situations for specific things right I think a AB testing is is really great if you've generally got your pricing strategy figured out and you just want to optimize the price level within like you know small small variation or maybe you just kind of you're unsure about whether this particular feature goes in the middle package or the the top package like for a very simple thing like that AB testing is great you're going to be able to get a good answer from that um relatively relatively quickly uh so long as you're in a business where you have enough kind of volume that you can you can get answers and get you know enough uh enough results to be able to draw a conclusion from that without sort of without having burned a lot of your actual demand through through doing that doing that experiment assuming you're in that situation I think it's great um where I think it's sometimes misused is like AB testing is not a good um approach to build an entire pricing strategy from scratch because you can only test what you test and usually you know as we talked about today there are so many different options that you can explore across your you know the packaging Styles and how you build them and and the metrics and everything else you just you you can't test enough stuff through ab AB testing that you would be able to get the answer and if you did it's kind of like the the Heisenberg uncertainty principle right like you can't measure anything without affecting it like every customer who comes and looks at your your pricing when you've done these different experiments is going to be influenced by that so you end up kind of affecting a lot of your potential customer base through through doing it so you're really better off I think doing research upfront to get the answer directionally right and then use AP AB testing if appropriate to just uh just take it from 90 95% to 100% makes sense looks like we have a question here from uh Hans will you overprice uh a corporate product just to show it's not cheap as cheap products look not good for a corporate client yeah so would you about say overpriced but definitely I mean i' I've seen case studies where um where um a client essentially was charging for a product not getting much traction in in in in the Enterprise segment and it was because they were pricing not not enough for it people people assumed it was it was not going to be good because it was it was priced too low and that's really I mean the van wendor Technique we talked about earlier right we have that too cheap level that's really what it is it's like if it's if it's going to be that low I just can't believe that it's any good so I'm gonna I'm going to discount it so I don't know that that's um that's overpricing I think it's just it's it's setting a fair price for the value that your your product does if you are if you are perceived um if you are in that sort of too cheap too cheap C category it's not that you'd be overpricing it by by raising it it's just that you're severely underpricing it right now yeah I know one of the challenges that could be for for companies that have different customer types let's say they're servicing both smbs and Enterprises if you display those prices on the website tyly for the smbs at volume uh you may you may be uh impeding how much you could actually charge uh from a a corporate client or an Enterprise client that typically would you know you you would also need to put more much more efforts uh around servicing um so any any thoughts of that with what have you seen some of your customers do when they have this kind of disparity between SI you know size and willingness to pay by different types of customers yeah I think the most common approach to that and I think it is best because you you are in the situation where you don't want to give the Enterprise clients your pricing because you want to speak to them you want to learn what they're willingness to pay is and you want to give them something quite custom but for a lot of the SMB clients I I've done research that says that you know 75% of smbs say that they would not even consider speaking to a vendor if they didn't display their price on their their website right there's quite a lot of times when they would they would expect that that transparency and usually the way that I see companies get around it is when they show their packages on their on their website they might have one or two or three packages that are tailored towards smbs and there they are transparent with their price they'll put what it is and then they'll have uh another package which is more tailored towards Enterprises which has all the features that the Enterprises might be interested in and there's basically where there should be a price there is a contact us here and you reach out and you go into that that process so as long as you you do have to make it clear that those packages that you have tailored to smbs are not going to be appropriate for the the Enterprises so sometimes that means putting a capacity constraint or you know a cap on the the number of users or usage or whatever it is but as long as you can do that that shouldn't sort of that shouldn't poison your your Enterprise customers while still giving the transparency that your your smv customers need perfect so last question from uh my side what's what's your opinion on uh promotional uh discounting where kind of all customers get the same discount for example we we just uh went through Black Friday so 50% off on all you know all products what do you think about that yeah yeah you know I think it's um it can be really effective right in different in different markets I think it's um it's very easy to overdo it uh I think it's uh if you over promote I think your customers learn that promotions are going to come across quite frequently right and it means that they're just going to wait around until a promotion comes and then they're going to buy it really I think where that I mean where where that strategy came from right it's more of a it's more of a retail thing that is kind of translated into into sassin Tech is it's a it's a method it's a method of price differentiation based on um the urgency of of the purchase right like you get to your most price sensitive customers by only giving them this lower price at a certain time which is probably a long time away so if they're willing to wait for this entire time to get that to get that uh that that deal they can buy it then and I think that that works as long as the promotions are frequent enough that somebody who really is willing to pay more is not going to want to wait the six months to get that that lower price they would rather just just buy it now that's great James uh we can be talking on and on there's so much this topic of pricing is uh is is so critical and there's uh lots lots of things that we could be talking about but uh given a time we're we're going to wrap up um how can people reach you if they have any questions what's what's the best way yeah absolutely um there's actually we can pop my pop my slide back up again there's a email address it's james. Wilton mate.com actually hold on let me get on to the page oops there you go perfect awesome so thanks James uh and uh thank you everybody who's been uh on the session hope you found it uh informative and uh we'll be in touch thank you fantastic thanks for having me thanks James bye.
