## Transcript

[Music] All right, welcome everybody. Excited to get rocking and rolling here. We're going to be talking about this idea of cracking the code on churn. We've got the churn doctor himself, Greg Danes. Him and I go pretty much way back.

I feel like this guy's um the the the doctor, truly the doctor when it comes to all things customer success. So, Greg, thanks for joining. How are you? >> My pleasure. I'm glad to be here. I'm great.

Thanks. >> Yeah. Where where did the turnd doctor idea I mean I know you've actually done now multiple things but where did that come from? What was >> I don't remember who coined it. I I don't love it to to be >> I didn't think you did. >> But after a while I find I I embraced it.

I love it. I I'm super into what I do. So why not? I'll take it. >> Well and it's funny because I I haven't told you this but yeah you've come up in one or two you know not not millions of conversations but like Greg D and then they will say like you know like that that turn doctor guy. So, it's I think it has stuck uh it has stuck just a little bit.

But anyways, we met um at our inside sales.com days. He's obviously jumped off and kind of run this consulting business that's really trying to help people understand. How do you crack the code on this retention problem that specifically in SAS we just can never figure out? It's been a hundred years, but I'm probably doing a poor overview. Tell us about some of the cool things you've been working on since the the inside sales taste. Yeah.

Well, I mean, it's all about this retention thing because everything's about that, right? Growth is totally dependent on that. And as a founder CEO, I was a founder CEO for many years. And I it drove me crazy, right, how inconsistent it is. You have one customer come in and they do really well and they stand on stage and brag about you. Another one looks similar yet they kind of go sideways and turn out.

Like that inconsistency drove me crazy. And so I I started to look at some of the things we say and one at a time started to discover actually most of the things we say about what works in SAS and customer success actually isn't even true. And so one of the things we do in in our work is we study it. We we we have this huge data set we've accumulated because we analyze customer turn at all these companies. And so I think we have the world's largest data set on detailed customer retention data.

And it's been fascinating. were able to analyze it and and really ask questions that frankly I wanted to ask forever and and in almost every case what they're doing is just knocking over these old you know uh sort of conventional ideas about what works and what doesn't work and that's been really fun and what we found is yeah there is a totally different kind of mindset that really does actually solve this problem. Yeah, but yeah, you're you're teasing us now too much. So, we we got to dive deeper into this topic because to your point, it you know, being on the marketing side, Greg, the challenge I've found more and more. It it's so hard to just continue to like double, right? I'm going to use the word MQL.

It's like every month I got to get 2,000 and then 4,000 and then 9, you know, 8,000 MQLs and and and it feels like the new grow. I mean, we just have to have a growth strategy that is more about mining the base, you know, keeping our current customers, growing more within them. And maybe that's just an excuse for me being a poor marketer, but some of the stuff you talk about, >> it just rings. It's just like this is a message I think everybody needs to hear. So, let's dive in.

you were obviously teasing that just a little bit, but I think one of the unique things about you is the data aspect, right? So many, no offense to the the book consultants out there who, you know, were at one company and wrote a book on something, but you've brought together this massive amounts of data. You just teased at the end by saying kind of we had some assumptions and a lot of those assumptions that you thought were wrong. Start big picture like, wow, over the past couple years, what have you discovered that's been like, oh crap, I believed that and that was not true. Well, I mean, I'll just start with the biggest one. It drove me crazy, right? And everyone's had this experience when a customer leaves and they say, "What a great experience it was working with your company." And you're like, "Yeah, that can't be true.

That makes no sense." >> Or you have a you have a customer that's always complaining and that they keep renewing. That that contradicts our fundamental belief, which is that happy customers stay and unhappy customers leave. Well, the data actually proves that's not true. that that fundamental it's almost like the fundamental axiom of business strategy for our whole generation has turned out to be false. It's not that it's not the only thing.

You got to pause there because that that is I mean how many books happy customers stay mad customers go net promoter score you know MPS um you know are they happy satisfied whatever word you want the whole Bane study you know the one question that changes the world so no offense but yeah you're kind of going against 100 years of conventional wisdom here >> I get it but it was my experience and so I I I was sort of like so NPS is a great thing actually because everybody decided to adopt NPS which means our data is is incredibly robust. We can study and the the problem with the old study is they were looking at the connection between NPS and company valuation and growth. >> The the real question is does NPS correlate to the thing that matters for growth, which is retention? >> Yeah. >> Do customers that are happy stay longer? And that's what we're able to study. And the crazy thing is, and I you can go download my book or whatever my website, but it's crazy.

The data shows there's literally no correlation between how happy customers report they are and how long they stay. Zero. It's not a weak correlation, Gabe. There's no correlation. Now, obviously, it matters if we make our customers happy.

I'm not saying that. It's that it has nothing to do with why they stay. And so, the longer we build on that and invest, you know, how much money's been invested in customer experience, I mean, it's billions. And by the way, another data point we have on that's interesting. Those investments paid off.

There's tons of improvement. Our data shows a steady improvement in customer experience. The irony is over the same period, five years, customer retention's gone down at twice the rate. >> That that I think is where this is getting real is is more or less what you just said. I mean, it's it's kind of like actually even on the the the growth side as well.

It's like the the rates of sales reps being able to hit their number are are going down even more now than they were, you know, when you and I were chatting back in our our our days at Inside Sales. retention like whatever it is it's it's not working and yes we have been focusing so much I think sometimes on like happiness but maybe we've been focusing on the wrong thing because to your point it just it hasn't been working um so that that's one of the big findings and is there another that one is like >> well I mean maybe just more recently you were curious like what are the late the latest trends well a lot of people said look you know u covid like that whole period increased churn actually just the opposite that was the one period where we seem to have a cause actually churn went way down during co >> um you know tons of fascinating things what affects churn if if it's not that what does almost everything so we've tested everything discounts drive churn free trials drive churn uh but the biggest one here's here's the most interesting finding in all the data if all of that's either weak or nothing then what is it like what's the thing is there one good indicator that predicts retention and it turns out there is in fact it's so good, it's so predictive, nothing even comes close. And that is measurable results. >> You know, I tell people that, yeah, customers, if your customers get measurable results, our data shows they essentially don't leave you. Turn for that group is so low it's irrelevant.

Customers who achieve measurable results stay six times longer on average than those who don't. So, so people say, "Okay, yeah, obviously." No, >> I was gonna say I'm like, it sounds obvious, but it it's not because no tool I've ever bought has ever gotten measurable results. >> Well, it you don't even know in most cases because here's the crazy thing. If we really believed that, we'd build tools that measure the results that you get. And almost no companies do that.

If we believed it, our customer experience, customer success teams would focus almost entirely on did you get results and why and when and how much. We don't even do it. We call you and we make friends with you. We focus on your experience. >> That that proves that whatever head nodding we do about well obviously nobody really believes it.

Nobody like the revealed preference is no one's investing in that. And and so go one more click into that because what do we do then? So you know I sell a a help desk tool, right? Let's say that for example. And um and I'm trying to just play the scenario out because when you say it's measure of results, part of me is like a duh. But now that I'm thinking about it, my brain is starting to fry because I'm like I don't know what I don't know what I So let's say I sell help desk. Walk through this scenario with I sell a help desk tool.

>> So a help desk tool or any other tool essentially has tons of measurement in it. It's measuring what you do. How many calls did you get? How long did it take to resolve them? Were they resolved satisfactory? You get a lot of reporting for that. But that's not why we have a help desk tool. Why do we have a help desk tool, Gay? What's the purpose? What's the result we bought it for? Not what do we want to do with it? See, the human mind is >> there go that right there.

That that's it. It's not what we want to do with it. You know, what was the end result? Because yeah, what we want to do with it is is what we obviously focus on average handle time probably. You know, we we resolve the ticket quickly, but that's kind of what we're what the tool is ultimately doing. But yeah, the the end result is I mean I think people wanted to in a lot of cases they wanted to see this cost center become a profit center.

You know, they wanted to actually grow their revenue from this tool. >> Um if not nothing else actually have people Well, I think buy more. That's probably what it was. They wanted to buy more. >> Right.

Exactly. So the point is we had a business purpose when we bought the thing, but then we shopped and what were we buying? Features. We wanted really good robust technology. So we buy features. We set it up and all we talk about after that is the things we're doing with the software.

When do we ever step back and say, did we get the thing we hoped for? And the company, the vendor themselves have not made it a priority to make sure that they owe us an answer to that question. And that to me is incredible. Companies saying they're customer centric because they ask you how you feel. Like, it's so funny. We think we're customercentric because I sent you a survey and asked you how you feel about me.

How do you feel about me? I love you. How do you feel about me? Like it's incredibly self Well, anyway, you get the idea. The irony is is almost painful. What I want to know is did you get the thing that you bought this for? Now, I have a great story from our inside sales days on this where a client was complaining endlessly about problems. Look at the problems.

They were real, but none of them were relevant to whether they were getting results or not. So, I asked, "What are the results like?" No one could tell me. Not in my team, not in their team. So, I pulled them and they were fabulous. Here's a customer who was getting tons of good results.

I walk it up to their leader, by the way, who wasn't in the meetings. Why? Because he didn't care about the feature problems. >> Yeah. >> I showed him the results. He said, "Nobody nobody's ever showed this to me.

This is great news." You see, we are we've got off track on the whole like why we were together, right? What is the whole point? I had this I had this experience years ago. Apple was my client. Very difficult client. Actually, the worst client I've ever had. Complain about everything demanding, etc.

And frankly, it was a miserable experience. This is a kind of a classic CS moment, right? And don't do this. This isn't a re This is a cautionary tale. Greg Greg's in this meeting and I'm like I I said to the guy, "Why why don't you just cancel? If you hate us this much, just cancel your contract, please." The guy said, "Why would we do that when you get us such great results?" And my reaction was to feel embarrassed because why did I ever think it was about anything else? We've missed the boat here. We have, you know, and and frankly, that was a really important moment for me.

We're not in business together. I I'm not here to make you happy. I'm here to make you money. >> Yeah. >> Right.

And we really need to get back to that. And what we're seeing is the companies that are crushing it on churn are the ones who've essentially committed to that. It's not that they don't want to make their customers happy. It's that that can't be number one. Right? And this is a concern with AI.

If we're just using it >> to leverage more and more customer happiness, it's not going to work. It might save you some money, but it's not going to work. >> Do you feel like the reason So I love that must have been an aha moment at Apple because yeah, that's kind of like the happiness is on the road to results or you know like but it can't be like the end destination or something that that's a great story. But do you feel like I'm again I'm thinking again of my fictitious example. Let's say I sell help desk or something.

But is it because we often don't build the systems in place to measure that kind of end result? like is it part of our tool or is it really just a mindset meaning we all get so focused on resolving their bugs and again getting that survey back that says they gave us an eight they they'll refer us. Um, is it a mindset thing or or do we not literally have like the the the muscle built in? Because I I think like maybe it's both because man, I think these companies they don't know how to do this, you know, like you look at any CSM and you tell them you selling a help desk now go do an executive presentation on results. It's got to just go boom, blow their mind like I don't know how to do that. Where are we? How come we're not doing it now? The conversation you and I just had about this hypothetical proves what the problem is because it's all those things you just said. The problem was you had to look off camera and say, "Well, what is a help desk for? Not what does it do? We all know what it does." You see, here's what happens.

My clients come to me, we have churn. Like >> we we're going to cut that part out of the podcast, by the way. That way that's not that wasn't supposed to happen. Sorry. Keep going.

>> No, but it's the perfect illustration of what happens all the time. I go to my clients. I'm like, "What is you know your key customer result?" Well, it could be anything. It's I mean, it's all over the place. No, it's not.

Here's the problem. You aren't thinking clearly about what you're for. You spend all day thinking about what you're doing and and so no, you haven't built the systems and all of the mechanization in place to measure it probably. And you don't and you don't have the mindset, but what does that even tell you? Do you even know what it is? Do you even understand precisely what your customers want from you? What the whole thing was about? And we assume we do. It's an arrogant assumption because it's not that it's not that straightforward.

Right now, the other problem is we have a large number of customers at every company who also don't even know what they did it for. They what remember I said they decided they needed to whatever the thing you said was like increase our post sales revenue or whatever. But then what did they do? They went shopping for features and they promptly forgot about what that fundamental goal was. Well, it sounds like you had that story at that inside, you know, that inside sales story where the leader was like, "No one showed me this or I" He was probably even surprised like >> it was like that light bulb like, "Yeah, this is what I wanted actually." >> Like a year and a half. >> Yes.

Exactly. Like I haven't heard this mentioned for a year and a half. I was so it was like thank you. Where did this come from? Suddenly all that stuff we were arguing about didn't even matter. >> Yeah.

>> Right. So we and so you know to your point one last thing when I go to product teams and I say look our tool is actually really good at producing this result is that how you think about your product roadmap and they're like no we get competitor analysis we're looking at complaints from customers our road map is chalk full of stuff that has nothing to do with that and that's crazy right so maybe the right answer to your question of course it's a mindset but it goes across everything this isn't a post sale mindset. This is a overall business. >> Yeah. Because Yeah.

You're saying you got to you got to educate the buyer sometimes potentially on like the purpose of it again. But you certainly have to equip your customer success team or your team with the ability to dialogue and transfer that what you do versus what you're going to bring to the table type of conversation. Yeah. >> Because that seems like a man I've been in a lot of QBRs that are to your point, okay, we resolved this many bugs. Your average handle time is is 5 seconds blah blah, you know, and it feels very obviously featurerich and >> and they still won't be happy.

It doesn't matter. You could resolve hundreds of issues. You could build every feature they ask for and they'll still leave you. It >> it turns out that they could be incredibly Oh, here's an interesting study from our data. So, I met this guy years ago who was the COO at Sun Micros Systemystems.

They were huge. They they built the camp. >> I remember the I've read a few books about that company. >> They were massive. Anyway, the guy the guy was like, "Oh, you know," he'd heard what I was saying.

He's like, "This is so interesting. We did this study where we divided our customers into two groups. The customers who'd had negative experiences and those who hadn't." And you know, they were we can do that with ticket data and stuff. We filter it out. And he said, "And we were going to go chase it down." But before we did, some knucklehead decided just let's just measure the average lifespan of those two groups so we have a baseline so then we can see if we improve.

And they were shocked to discover the customers who had had negative experiences had more than double the lifespan of customers who' never had a negative experience. And they're like, "Wow, >> what gives, right? Are we supposed to give them a negative experience?" Of course, that has nothing to do with it. What it is is that the customers who get results are the ones who engage deeply with your product. >> Yeah. >> And engaging deeply with your product is what produces negative experiences.

>> Yes. And actually, that's a good, to your point, it could be a good thing because Yeah. They're like really running it through the rigor and they're beating it up and so they're obviously frustrated but to your point I can be super frustrated. Uh but I can also you know be seeing those those results so I'm happy. Wow.

Dang it. That is such a contra that's like a conundrum a contradiction a jumbo shrimp moment here you know. What do you do then Greg? I want to get to your thoughts on AI here in just a minute and how this all plays a role. But what's the without giving away too much of the secret sauce, this is the aha that you're helping kind of companies recognize, it feels easy to do, but I I it feels very different. How have you coached organizations? What what's some of the basics to like get guys couple basic steps you'd give to the audience to just start to move from kind of where they are to where they need to be to solve this kind of con conundrum? >> So, so here's another one that's a little bit counterintuitive, but go with me on it.

Stop looking at your failed customers. People think, "Look, if we want people to stop leaving, let's find out why they're leaving and we'll solve that and they'll stop leaving." Doesn't work. Never seen it work. Those exit surveys never produce reductions in churn. Why? It doesn't make sense.

If we solve a big problem that they said was why they left, then then they'll stop leaving. No, never works. Why? It's because all those reasons they give you, you're talking to the wrong customers. You're talking to customers who didn't win, who didn't get results. So, they actually don't have any idea what went.

Talk to your successful customers. Go find customers who are getting results. Find out what they care about, how they measure it, and then what they did to achieve it. Because what you want to do is bottle that. >> Your post sale process needs to be what do the good customers do first, second, third, fourth, step by step that led them to where they're at, not where are they now.

Because they your good customers tend to be doing really cool advanced stuff. Don't ignore that. What did they do first, second, and third? and the rest of your customers need to follow a process like that. AI has an opportunity here, but it's not about reproducing what you're doing now. And it's not about customer engagement.

It's about combining a clear understanding of what results you drive that are compelling enough that your customers never leave you. And then secondly, guiding customers through the steps. Second suggestion, your customers aren't failing in your software. They're failing outside your software. It isn't if you look at, you know, that customer fail.

Well, the story postmortem the story is they were really sucky at their business and they made this terrible decision. It isn't that they can't use your software. That's not the problem. >> They're not using your software because they're bad at their business. We exist to help those customers get good at their business.

So here's a big I think both a big hole in the current model and a huge opportunity for AI if people will seize it which is we have to combine the tech expertise which is actually much more trivial than we think it is with the domain expertise of how you succeed in that business just because it's shared experience. I'll go back to inside sales. Our successful customers weren't good at our software. They were good at selling and they used our software to to become better. Our failing customers could make huge progress if we would just teach them how to be better at selling.

And we we have this false idea that well, you know, how they run their business, that's their that's their thing. We just do the software. Big mistake. >> Cross that boundary. AI can do this, but we can do it.

And I would recommend doing it first before you hand it to AI, which is what's the magic combination of how you use our system and how you run your business. That I call it expertise. It's not a great word. It's the best one I've got. That's the magic.

We go down that road. That's the second thing I tell people. Know what you your results are and what works and then bottle it in a very prescriptive process and step your customers through them. >> Jeez, man. Geez.

That's that's that is a little harder though that like domain expert, you know, cuz love obviously it resonates with me, but you know, you sell a sales tool, but you also have to kind of teach them how to sell. And when you get the combo, because you're right, the best customers, they sold pretty well and then they sold even better with like a tool. >> Can can I can I just tell a quick a uh inside sales story just cuz now I'm like now I'm in the mode. I one of the first things I did was I went to some of our successful customers and I'm like teach me. So I went to Farway City.

I want reveal the customer. It's a famous company and I'm like you guys are killing it. I saw you stand on stage and and give a speech about how good your results are. He's like oh yeah this has been great. I said okay show me how you use the system.

He goes, "Oh, we don't use the system." I'm like, "Wait, what?" He goes, "Yeah, there's been some problems integrating it. We're in the middle of it, you know." I'm like, "That was six months ago when you stood on stage. Like, you've been with us a year. What?" "Yeah, I know it's been, but we're almost to the end. We're going to get it turned on." Like, that how do you explain that you said you got better results? He said, "Oh, no, that's really interesting.

When we first signed up with you, we were trained in a better sales method." >> Wow. >> That was independent of the And you know all about that, Gabe, because you probably ran the training. Did you run the training? I think you did. >> And the guy said, "That training alone," he showed me the little poster in each cubicle. Just those principles have increased our sales 30%.

>> Dang it, dude. >> And I'm like, that is the perfect illustration of what we're missing here. It's not People don't want your software, they want results. They're not buying software, they're buying results. But here's the main thing.

Your software, your technology doesn't produce results. Their process change produces results. And your software makes it possible and scalable. Yeah, >> that's the big like that's the big aha moment. So, we have to shift from implementing software, selling software to implementing results and focus on what process.

Now, it might seem complicated. The one thing I will say, you're right. It's like, oh, well, that's that's daunting. I have to do tech and I have to do expertise. No, actually, it's not that daunting.

And you know why? Because the customers who need it, the customers who dominate your churn, every company listening, most of the customers that churn at your company are not advanced customers. that happens and when it does there's big news and everyone runs around screaming and blood flows in the streets and everything. But the reality is the vast majority of return when we analyze it is smaller, younger, less sophisticated customers that actually don't know what they're doing. So the good news is the expertise you need is not actually that variable. It's >> Yeah, >> if you are in park, here's how you get into first gear.

>> Yeah, that's true. >> Simple. And and you know they have that there's that line like a a good tool with a bad process you know still just makes the process actually even worse right or it's like that d you know even AI AI with bad data just is you know more gar more bad data it's just more badness right and so >> it's funny we often think I'm just going to implement the tool into this process in sales that is broken and all of a sudden it's going to be a sa no system has ever been a savior let's just say that right it's like you have to you have to put a system into an optimized process. Now, oh my Greg, you've got something here, man. This is super interesting.

Um my goodness. Do you um so you've hit on AI a few times. I just want to end with AI is all the buzz and and I love that you've and maybe that's the point you're kind of making like you figure out your process and how you run this then you sprinkle AI on you you've got something even more special. But how does AI fit into some of the stuff you're seeing into the CX world right now? >> Yeah. So, so I think we're going to go through a whole uh era where we're using it wrong.

We're just trying to do CX and we're trying to improve experience assuming that will work. It won't. So, I've made that. >> I don't know if you saw I should send you Mackenzie just came out with a study. They're like 80% of AI stuff is fake totally failing.

So, I think they're agreeing with you that it's >> No surprise. But what I just said is actually kind of special. So if you think, okay, let's do what Greg says. Let's do a postale experience that combines knowledge of our software with some industry knowledge, which is what we were doing at inside sales and companies do this. >> It's actually hard to do and it's really hard to scale.

>> Um, if I'm I don't know if I'm uh Survey Monkey, can I go out and find people who've used Survey Monkey to build small marketing operations for small companies? Yeah, there's tons of them, but they don't work for me. and they don't want to be CSMs on my team. Yeah. >> What I need to do is to find a way to in a sense build an ecosystem of that kind of basic domain and technology combined knowledge. The reality is I don't I don't know how to do that in a practical sense.

There's people trying to do it a little bit without AI. So I actually think maybe not this year or next year but soon we're looking at AI agentic AI that that combines knowledge of the software with basic domain knowledge to really help these customers. I actually think that's a huge opportunity because it's really difficult to do with people even though Okay, hold on. We should do that. So, don't wait for AI.

Start now because only if you've tried it and and gotten your feet wet a little bit will you know because here's the thing about AI. It'll do what you tell it to do. >> That's that's the problem, right? Back to the old same thing with the old tool we were saying. You know, you can't just throw AI and be this magic pill. I think that's actually what the McKenzie thing is saying.

It's like you still have to like figure out the process or to your point, the domain expertise to kind of put the this AI to use because it's only as good as its master right now. Oh man, Greg. Oh, dude. Dang it. I need to like rethink my life.

Um, okay. So, I have some things I got to figure out. So, a lot a lot to take in. If someone wants to learn more about some of the cool stuff you're doing or dive into this, what what would you recommend or how do I get in touch with you? >> Well, I have my website, gregdaines.com, or you can check me out on LinkedIn. I've posted a bunch of stuff and videos and stuff.

I have a couple uh like white papers you can download for free. They're really interesting. They have all this research. You wondering what is Greg talking about? All the charts are in there. You can paste them into your decks and show to your boss and have these conversations and go to town.

But also reach out to me. There's a place on my website. I'm happy to chat. Love to meet people. Um love it.

>> Cool. All right. Well, Greg, again, appreciate the time. Really fun talk track for the audience. Have a fantastic day.

>> Yeah, you bet. [Music].
