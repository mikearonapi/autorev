names and titles and companies please in the chat that's great to see uh really excited to uh have a really dynamic group here today uh focused on discussing community marketing um as a and you know today we're really drilling into more of the product-like growth use case but obviously community marketing is an area um where we're seeing a lot of uh growth and just an explosion of interest across b2b staff so really excited to bring in some uh experts in here today to talk about um one just over we're gonna we're gonna go through uh how to think about community and how to get it started and for your organization uh we're also gonna talk about different ways to engage your community and really drive growth and then finally around measurement um and also uh reporting um components as well so i just wanted to introduce both tomer uh and mac um and so if you guys could just uh get on the video and uh introduce yourself homer please go first thank you whit um so my name is tomer i'm the founder and chief product officer of dremeo which is a sql uh lake house awesome hi i'm uh i'm mac i'm the founder and ceo of compsor and we're the i guess community operating systems we call ourselves we're like the data back end for community teams absolutely thanks guys um you'll be hearing from both of them a little bit later in the presentation um and again if you have any questions uh please feel free to put them into the q a as we go and we'll also be have some time at the end as well um just to kick things off um we're going to start with a poll um to just you know kind of level set and understand exactly where everyone is in their community marketing journey um let's see if i can find these christina do you know where these are we actually are not going to do a poll it did not load okay well i guess we're not doing the poll today which is fine uh if you you know again they're kind of each person's uh companies in their different stages of their uh journey um for community um but today we'll go over the uh overview about how to do it so let me just give up this presentation here we'll just switch that over um great so today's topic is activating community for product life growth companies and really that we're going to be discussing today is how to build an organic flywheel around your community and drive actual business pipelines from it um so again a very highly highly growth stage space right now and motion that's generally new in the market what we're seeing um and we're seeing a lot of interesting trends around the portfolio so just a level set here um product growth just gets thrown around as a buzzword a lot in b2b staff um it's the thing to know is that product like growth is more than just selling through the product it really is the evolution of revenue generation so plg is the concept of using product and revenue model design to engage acquire and upsell your customers plg is not just a free trial or freemium product um it relies on the product itself as the primary driver of customer engagement and expansion you know some people on the line you know feel free to please put in the chat if you're currently using a plg model or you're something you're evaluating um appropriately the reason why you would do that is effective plg growth really helps you labor the revenue engine it empowers your end users to find evaluate and adopt your product on their own and equips your sales success and marketing teams with data and that's really the key point we'll be talking about that more around the data because that's what we're really seeing companies to succeed in this space um and they're connecting the data pipes to the community over to the revenue um mainly we see plg use for customer acquisition uh scalably and effectively acquire customers with free uh free products or trial motion um also in sales so automated revenue generation engine uh and then finally empowering sales and customer success teams so giving them the insights to help drive engagement so when you think about plg um it could be a useful lever to achieve a couple of key objectives so um one is just overall lower acquisition costs it allows the product to do the work of sourcing and qualifying leads and this will allow you to win more customers with fewer resources over time now uh obviously if your product is not built for plg upfront that will require some pretty significant rethinking and investments so but the the net overview is a net overall gain is in the long term you'll see lower acquisition costs two is around proof sales efficiency so you increase the size of your funnel um you provide the sales team with the with data um and the highest potential targets um and then three is around reduction in churn for large accounts so because you're you have people um using uh the plg motion you have the data and you can create stickiness around it and just overall advocacy within the organization again we'll show you some examples of that later in the presentation so why community and why does it connect to product led growth actually community marketing has a lot of similar objectives um as plg they kind of go hand in hand but you do see companies that don't have plg motions leveraging community as well um the goal of community is really uh we've got five different points here one is to create clear pathways for frequent customer feedback and advocacy you get nice transparency um and you get customer feedback uh that you can if you can actually uh analyze um and surface within your organization two is building that organic flywheel of content adoption usage and referral so um companies that have strong community emotions generally have referrals word of mouth and overall just their communities contributed to content uh as well three is reducing the dependency of paid channels so if you have a strong organic flywheel of community you don't have to go out into the market and spend as much money on adwords and other paid advertising four is allowing for product adoption in larger enterprising camps so we talk about a bit of land and expand or you have a bottoms up top down so communities strong community motions allow for low friction adoption and then that feeds over for the to the top down enterprise sale and then finally is nurturing products taking us customer attention all those things expansion so you know again if you have a good community they're spreading your product throughout the organization if people try and love your product and they're they're spreading the word uh they generally have high retention so this is uh this is scales the insight snow owl um and uh just giving kind of a warning um a bit so not every company is qualified to build a vibrant user community so i think it's really important to really kind of nail down who you're targeting and who is the best fit for this um so i think it's easy to say okay i want to do community marketing but you really have to take a step back and determine whether community is the right fit for you and your product so we have a compelling value proposition but ultimately you need to get user adoption right and engage a broader ecosystem um beyond just your product so generally what we recommend is you you take a look at your current customers right so um you see where your product usage is the highest within your core group of customers and then look at the usage and see what the persona is and whether there is a broader attraction within that and use case that exists beyond your product this can be helpful as you're evaluating new verticals because if you find a more horizontal use case um you can apply that um and spread the word two is just generally end users first right so you want people who are subject matter experts and engaged in their field to be contributing to the community conversation um usually if you have economic buyers unless they're highly technical you should be adding them to more of a customer advisory board level and not as much on community but again if they are highly technical and use the products and love it definitely definitely uh wrap them in and then three is the knowledge gap this is really critical so you can get your customers on a customer community and i think max can talk a little bit more about what that looks like later in the presentation but um when you think about the knowledge gaps you really want to look at where the market exists beyond your product and your customers and thinking about what the gaps are because topics must really be more product agnostic and help attract observers who may not be even know who what your brand or your product is we've provided this handy worksheet you can kind of use to determine who your ideal community user profile you know when we talk to our portfolio companies we do this community marketing jumpstart um you really want to start here um there are a lot of different user profiles potentially that you may want to bring into your community but again you really want to understand where the white space is and whether there is there is not a community that's currently serving um serving these customers and these different user profiles so you want to prioritize these you want to take a look at the segment um bucket these out also just generally the value proposition right what can our community offer to this segment that nobody else can so you want to really do your market research and stress test it if there are any job titles of these people that fall into this segment for targeting definitely want to flag those you're fit high medium low whether it's a large opportunity size or small um and then what are they just focused on accomplishing what are their pain points and then finally do you do you have the infrastructure and content to be able to really go to market and attract this this profile so this can allow you to uh enable you to figure out exactly who you should target to get your community started then once you've really determined your segment you think okay this is a compelling segment that i want to target for my community um you're going to need some tools and some foundations right so we've kind of laid out in four different categories one's obviously a crm a cms and a map a lot of companies obviously have these in place already so it's just obviously the core marketing automation platform um and tools that your company would use even for an enterprise sale however what we do see is that um companies do tend to splinter out different since communities a bit more volume and velocity and less around getting user adoption for the comedian have separate goals um they companies generally don't want to pollute their marketo instance or product or hubspot with user community data so they'll convert over opportunities when it's actually a real sale because then you're going to have to pay more for the record maintenance et cetera so just something to consider as you think through this um community platform generally our portfolio companies uh use discourse um they're also they're social influentive and tribe which have different integrations that this course doesn't necessarily support engagement tools these are your you know virtual events webinars platforms zoom slack uh we see discord um increasing uh in usage as well uh the unit economics can be a little bit more appealing to slack or you know sometimes you're targeting a user base that generally enjoys discord and then finally i know some measurement uh can't help but give max a shout out here on the comp source side but then obviously um the reality is that community marketing is a bit from from the analytics perspective you're going to kind of have to pave your own path a little bit here so we have you know orbits in that in option and so segment and if you're so we've seen companies kind of hack it together that way sometimes you just use a spreadsheet when you get started so okay uh activating the community to drive the business impact so we've talked about you know the foundations how to think about getting the community started uh now let's move over to think about once you have a community up and running how do you connect that to drive uh impact for your business so the key goals of enroll of your organization within a community it's kind of funny it's so different from a top down sale or traditional demand gen where you're going out the market you're trying to you know you have messaging you're targeting you're actively pushing it for a community you want to take a very hands-off approach and you want to build and maintain infrastructure for a sustainable ecosystem two is then is publishing the relevant content including the thought leadership best practices and up-to-date technical documentation that the community would want to engage with three is just then going out to market attracting influencers and activating them uh through engagement um you want to create authentic and value-add interactions this isn't about selling right now this is about connecting people who have are different levels of interest and education within the market and really want to learn more and understand it so people who are highly influential can attract other people in the market who are just getting started so you definitely want to leverage influencers to do that and then finally is collecting insights so this is key um one of the key uh points of community is that you have access to so much data in terms of different use cases different engagement et cetera you can use those to inform your product roadmap messaging uh and your demand gen as well so definitely not positive here so this is um through a company out there called orbit um we really like this i think it's really interesting to see some companies start to adopt this um so uh when you think about the community it's really at the center of all these different rings of people around your community um and then affinity are there you're kind of measuring uh your community by two different metrics one is affinity and one is influence so affinity is a member's level of engagement with the community this can be measured by collecting data against the key activities that are creating value right so if they attended a user conference hosting a virtual event uh contributing technical documentation et cetera those should have different affinity scores to understand whether people are engaged with you or not then there's influence right so different community members are going to have a sphere of influence and that's based on their reputation credibility and the size and quality of their audience in the ecosystem so you really want to look at people who have high influence you know it could be their job title at a company that's particularly uh in the space they may have a big following on twitter they may actively do thought leadership contributions maybe they wrote a book on the subject right um another one you can look at is open source projects that they've created and if they have traction on github for example so if they have high influence they're going to pull different members who are just on the outside looking in further and further to the center and then when you think about your marketing for the community you really want to segment the community into different levels right so on the outside you have your observers who are looking in then you have your participants your contributors advocate advocates are your closest to the center those are the ones that you want to have the most influence and they're attracting everyone else into the middle but each of these different levels is going to qualify for different marketing so generally if you're on the outside it's just content to raise awareness the further and further you get more closer to the center uh the more uh attractive and interesting the programs become so you may invite them to a user forum and then if you're in the next level in they may qualify for company swag uh et cetera um and the great thing is you you you segment this out by the affinity score right so if you're taking a look at activities they're taking uh you can calculate different scores based on the data that you're pulling in to be able to segment out your marketing programs uh appropriately um so this is a kind of a real world example of what that might look like so how does this relate to plg right so we just talked about community right we've gone into detail about how to think about it how to score it um so community really powers that organic plg flywheel so when you think about the flywheel um you're gonna have different community tools and programs your technical documentation your discord your forums uh uh uh for a scaling company you may have training and tutorials at youtube your user conference et cetera those are gonna live in this flywheel which is going to drive demand so for customers that are looking for your product um the infrastructure and tools such as the technical documentation your social media et cetera are going to help them find and discover your company once you get them into that funnel then the then your community edition is going to provide very low friction ways to try out try your products um and get into it then the forums and the discord are going to be able to provide the support that they need to convert and then finally um once they've converted and become have become customers you have all the meetups and events to nurture um and speaking opportunities that's all going to create content which is going to funnel back to the find and discover so it creates this nice flywheel effect where you're you're out in market you're attracting people you get them into the product through low friction waves then you nurture um you nurture uh retention and excitement for your product and then that's going to create more contact content and data to attract more people so here's an example of what this looks like so postman is a portfolio company and they have this awesome public api network um this really uh they take a very editorial approach to it um and it's created by community members and customers alike um they actually recently held a community hackathon to develop innovative apis and windows are now public and featured at the top of the network page that has this api network has helped fuel pr content their social media they even because it is such an open collaboration um system uh they even have customers like paypal for example who have written their own case studies about how they are leveraging the platform so a lot of earned medias get out there um and generate overall interest and demand for for their products so further down the funnel getting people to try it once you kind of have your buyers attention uh mural for example has really built out a robust content ecosystem to educate um customers who now are you know have some awareness um and then uh really incentivizing them to try if you look at all their content there's a lot of call to actions and really getting you know raising awareness of the trial um the other thing they do is they have these pre-populated templates based on fire use cases it allows empowers the users to really self-select into the different flows to understand how the product applies to their use cases and then just overall their trial is very very low friction it's really easy to get set up they don't have a lot of long and complicated web forms there another thing that they do again going back to the influencers they really curate industry experts current customers uh and academics for weekly webinars about the the subject matter so you know bringing in people who have influence in the space and having them talk about different topics and again that raises awareness but then also provides value for current customers as well so here is the key and this is really where the data becomes the most interesting um so it really is on um on the marketing and the go to market teams um to build the bridge between the end user and the buyer so the user community may give you or will give your organization access to valuable data content and the intelligence to inform your demand gen motion so on the left you can see your community marketing you're acquiring end users you get that bottom product adoption on the right you see is your traditional kind of product like growth demand gen you're so there you're targeting more economic buyers and for those you're going to be looking for at product files and pipelines dollar the data content the use cases the reviews and referrals are all different data points and ammunition to kind of drive and connect the dots um for you for your demand gen engine so that's why the community marketing it can be so valuable but obviously it's on the organization to really build a very clean bridge uh between those two things we'll talk about that um an example of this is just user invitations so it will enable sharing and spread your product virally through targeted organizations if you can if you can pull this one off um postmonday.com and your we love we love mural on this webinar but actually i think mural is really interesting because it's not like a super developer heavy persona they just are they're a little bit more broad marketplace they've done a great job with their community but you can see because you invite your team into the monday monday instance or the mural instance um it provides uh pathways to other teams within the organization now once you've done that once you see different pockets of demand in the community you really want to lead score them so um we have some definitions here on pql um that's matching the customer's ideal profile you want to set a threshold for that um and whether the lead has exceeded the score predetermined by end product actions to accurately signal the purchase intent so you're going to be looking at the firmographic and technographics so if people in your community have corporate email addresses um or maps the overall icp um and you can start seeing uh user adoption within your target uh to target customer profiles and then finally behavioral right what are they actually doing in the product itself so creating a profile their body team members building that first workflow etc and that will calculate your overall lead scoring um to really understand whether community efforts are driving product qualified leads for your business once you get them into the trial the nurture strategy is key this is kind of a part of area where companies tend to invest in laughs i would invest first so thinking about your notifications of what that customer journey looks like and both your notifications and emails should really work in tandem to generate those pql lead scoring pieces here you know it's great to have a lead scoring model but if you don't have the um automation and the marketing to actually kind of drive it through uh if this is a critical piece of of the of the funnel um and definitely something that should be started with um to drive customers um to convert and how you do this is really you know some some companies use gamification right so uh nearpod for example rewards users for completing tasks or continue usage um it could be some other milestones just raising awareness people love email recaps of the different points and the stats that they've accumulated in the product so it also provides clear reminders of what they've they've achieved and gets them back into the product you can also offer prizes if you want you know again uh physical goods t-shirts you'd be amazed how far swag goes i'm sure tomer's got some pretty good war stories about how that's how that's worked for him so i'll refer to him on some of those tactics so to summarize really when you think about your plg marketing you really want to actively engage your user to use your product and that will conver increase your conversion probability to at the end of your of your trial um or or uh free edition so one is just establishing a predictable cadence of communication you know proactively nudging your customer users push notifications good strong onboarding this does clear expectation keeps them in the loop um and top of mind people get distracted very easily right so it's important to keep people focused and moving two is marketing products really need to be fully integrated so marketing needs to be triggered based on in-product behaviors and lead score values both of those teams really need to work hand-in-hand to pipe those data points in three is quantifying your user progress and proactively communicate again as i mentioned people love stats summaries milestone celebrations getting them back in incentivize that for other usage people do get very distracted so it's important to keep them on task four is actively testing new messaging programs so you know don't set it and forget it once you check something off you should always be looking at your performance and understand how you can improve your performance and then finally really just engage your customer i mean this sounds like so basic but it's true you know you may have enterprise grade software but you're we're seeing more and more uh especially for you know in the as you're going for more community marketing motion uh enterprise grade software really doesn't have to be boring so you can try to have some fun with it and get get your users involved um so that wraps up my section i'm going to pass it off to tomer who's going to talk a little bit more about how to actually put this into action in some use cases uh tilmer i think it's funny usually when i give this talk i usually have a dremeo example spot you know kind of position within it to show how you guys do it but since we actually have you on the phone uh for this one i i figured it'd be better to let you talk about it sounds like a plan uh we want to launch the polls they are loaded if we want to use this oh amazing all right so yeah let's take a minute we'll watch we'll uh we'll just launch all the polls now and just do it um and then uh let's just take a take a pause there okay okay wonderful first one's coming up now okay so the question is what is the current stage of your organization's community um our community is you know kind of self-driving you're getting some traction you're looking at an initial pilot you're evaluating it or you you may not just be have anything in the hopper right now you're just here to learn a little bit more about it so love to learn more about that let's give it a minute okay great so you can see most people are starting to seriously evaluate or they're just here to learn so that's great um see the next one okay so what tools and programs are you're leveraging to nurture your engagements we talked about some of this so if you do have your community up and running technical documentation should be you should be able to select multiple so just everything that you're currently using love to understand you know what is the most popular just give it a minute okay [Music] okay number one webinars we have number two technical documentation by using their meetups yup very popular community forum we have some user conference as well um unsurprisingly community or open source edition is a little less adoption but you know about 13 of people that are doing something around that so that's pretty impressive all right final poll and then we'll move on so how are you currently measuring the business impact of your community and it could be multiple choice again so any of these um that you're looking at so you maybe you don't have kpis which i think is pretty typical um it's just about an or it's important strategic positioning but could be looking at community size growth could be looking at engagement maybe even on community influence pipeline dollar i'd love to hear a little bit more of uh people's people's focus here as they build the community out all right so yeah so more strategic initiative community size growth about what we expected some pipeline dollar there and engagement not so much influence or or lead gen currently today very cool great thank you so much uh tomer i'm gonna let you uh take it away all right thank you um so i figured i would just start with one one slide just tell you who i am or who who the what dremeo is um since many of you are probably not coming from the data space um so we uh jeremy is a sql lake house and what that means is we enable companies to run their bi workloads so things like dashboards you know tableau power bi look or things like that directly on data lake storage so systems like s3 and adls and the idea really is to eliminate the need for proprietary and expensive data warehouses so you don't have to go through all that paying off kind of moving data into a warehouse and creating lots of copies and extracts and cubes and so forth uh companies uh in in that growth phase we've been growing uh over over 100 uh every year since uh since the beginning and in the last year we raised 200 million and some of that has come from uh from insight um and uh uh lastly we also invest a lot in open source and community and that's one of the things i'll talk talk about today and so we've created a couple open source projects and we also run a great conference so the first thing i think when you think about community um is well what are you building the community around right there there can be a number of different things as a company that you have an opportunity to build community around and so um the first one really is um are you part of some new stack or some new architecture and that is emerging and that there is excitement around and maybe you're creating that excitement as well and so we've seen a lot of examples of this in in kind of history there was the lamp stack there's the now there's uh uh something called the jam stack for uh static websites uh you know back in the days when hadoop was an exciting things in big data there was a whole stack of technologies and projects you could use there um and so i'll talk about you know an example here for for us which is that we're part of this new kind of open architecture for for analytics the second opportunity you have of course is your own product right so be able to create that kind of community um of users of users of the product right so um this really of course requires a like was talking about a critical volume of users right people that use the product and um and then is there enough meat to kind of warrant a conversation around it right so even if you do have a lot of users you know it might be hard to build a community say uh you know on my iphone i have a calendar app right and uh you know a lot of people use that calendar app with the ios but whether you could really build a community around that that might be a hard thing right and then finally maybe within your product you've built some building blocks that are not just kind of internal implementation components of your own product but also things that other people use and often that that takes the form of some open source library or some open source kind of building block that you've created and that has become popular and that you have an opportunity to kind of create mind share and create community around that piece of your product as well so looking at these three examples uh for us at dremeo and this is uh where i'll kind of use our company as an example of how we leverage these types of things the first one is this new new stack right so this open data architecture and just briefly and kind of what's going on in our world is you have this kind of shift that's happening in the industry from closed data architectures to the kind of open data architecture right so similar to app development where it's gone from monolithic to kind of microservices uh we see that happening in the world of data analytics where you know that kind of the traditional approach every every data warehouse every database has its own storage and those are kind of siloed from each other and independent of each other and two really this new architecture some called the lake house some called the the cloud data lake but fundamentally it's one where you have kind of a common data uh tier the the data is its own tier it's stored in open formats and you have a variety of different engines you can use on top of that things like dremeo and you know databricks and confluent kafka lots of open source projects you can use so it's it really shifts that kind of um the entire architecture for for data analytics in the cloud and so this gives us an opportunity to create a community around kind of this new architecture and create excitement around this new architecture and one of the ways we do that is by having a conference and so we started this conference called subsurface or subsurface live and the name comes from the world of data lakes that we live in so kind of diving under the surface of that data lake um and so this is a conference actually the next one is july 21 so coming up here and we do this every six months and this has really grown to now over 10 000 attendees it's uh it's virtual because we started it during uh kind of the early days of covid um and um what you'll find if you go to that website is that we have a lot of speakers here and they're not all talking about dremeo so they're talking about a variety of different technologies in this stack um and that includes everything from kind of the query execution engines to the you know different open source uh projects that represent kind of the data formats that includes how data's transported over the wire different visualization tools things like superset which is an open source bi tool various orchestration tools things like airflow and prefect and daxter and things like that so lots of different technologies um that are kind of represented at this conference and so that creates a lot of excitement and a lot of opportunity for people to come and learn at this event and not just learn about our own product but learn about kind of this new shift that's happening and all the different players and components in this snack so it's a great opportunity for people out there in the community to come in and kind of educate themselves and uh and then it also for us as a company it it really draws uh people to uh kind of engage with dremeo that maybe hadn't even heard about us or weren't even thinking about wanting to learn about dremeo because now they're coming to our conference and really to learn about a variety of different things right even if they're they're using some competitor of ours this conference still relevant to them and so that's one of the uh kind of strategic reasons for for doing this one of the other things the other things that it does is it you know creates a lot of content right so that content has kind of a longer shelf life than the conference itself so that's in terms of the uh kind of the creating that community around the bigger the bigger stack um but we also do a lot of things to create community around the product itself and one of the kind of the very common examples that many companies use and we do as well is we have a a forum right so when users of our product and especially our community edition which is our free version they use the product and they don't have enterprise support they don't have a phone number they can call 24x7 but they do have these forums here that they can come to and engage and ask questions and many times you know you'll see somebody from dremel answering a question but often you'll also see people in the community answering these questions um and so the forums i think people see them often think about them as kind of this very narrow tool that is just for kind of q a but really there's a lot of benefits to having a a forum like this right it drives more engagement for uh for your users it leads to kind of collaboration it helps from an seo standpoint because now you've basically outsourced content creation to uh to your users and so if you have you know 10 people or dozens of people posting every day well that's a lot of content that's getting created that you're not paying for right and it's this content that really kind of attracts that long tail of google searches right people are searching for this weird thing that you never would have built a web page to optimize for that but because you have this very vibrant community and this very vibrant form you're able to capture those searches a more kind of uh you know targeted approach in terms of kind of community and this really really focuses more on the advocates for your for your product and in the community is things like third party review sites so this is an example from uh from g2 crowd where you know we have uh various reviews from people that use the product and they come and kind of express their their thoughts their opinions their their rankings right very similar to uh you know what you see on amazon when you have reviews of a product so this is more geared towards kind of enterprise and sas products and so that's an important thing to focus on as well uh often you have to kind of set up some incentives for uh for people to go in and write these reviews um you can't tell them you know how to rank you or what to write but um but you can kind of incent them to at least go in and put in the effort to submit something and then finally the concept of building blocks and this might not be relevant to every company out there but if you do have something within your product that is um of interest to others um not not because it's your product but just because you know it's something that you've built and other people use as well well that's also an opportunity to create some community around that that building block so for us this means these open source projects that we've created or co-created over the years and these are basically components of our product that we for strategic reasons decided to open source one example of this is the aero project which is basically a cross language development platform for in-memory analytics so we early on we took our internal memory format and we said wouldn't it be nice if our dremeo's internal memory format was an industry standard everybody used that and that would long term have some strategic advantages for us uh where we could more kind of integrate better with with various systems and so we open source that and fast forward uh you know a few years it's very widely adopted over 20 million downloads a month right so that's one example aeroflight's another example that we're very much focused on right now which is kind of extending arrows so that different components different different processes and applications can kind of communicate with each other at much higher rates than what was previously possible and that again is something we're doing in open source and then finally nessie is a uh is our most recent kind of open source project which is really about providing a get like experience for data so in the same way that with uh when you're using git to write code you can create branches and you can you know do version control of your uh your source code nessie provides that for for data and that's another thing that we've done as an open source project really more for reasons of enabling tighter integration right one of the benefits of open source is that it makes it easier for you to integrate with various projects and companies that are out there but one of the benefits of having these things is that you can start to create a community around these building blocks and so in the example of apache arrow that's a download over 20 million times a month at now and that basically from the the days that we and we open source that and kind of collaborate with others in the community to do that and that's really taken off so every data scientist that uses python now uses uh uses arrow and one of the things you'll find if you go to the contributors list on github is that the vast majority of contributions now are not from our engineers right so these are things that we're not paying for but the excitement around the project and the amount of visibility that we get because of it is significant right and so that sometimes it actually there there are various different benefits to con contributing something that you've done to open source so the last thing i want to talk about um you know beyond kind of the the different types of communities that you're or that you can or the different things you can build a community around is also how to think about kind of building that community or bootstrapping it so when you think about each of these uh you know platforms or websites or or events whether it's a conference or your blog or it's um you know your forums um there's always the question of okay how do i get started here right and uh in any of these kind of platforms you could think of it as you know consumers and producers so there are consumers these are the people that are consuming the content right they are reading the posts on your forum they're reading you know articles on your blog post they're attending your conference because they want to listen to some talk and maybe they're using some open source technology that you've created right so these are consumers and these are folks in the community and then you have the producers and these are the people that are you know they're actually creating the content so on your forum they're responding to posts maybe they're contributing blogs to your blog or they're speaking at your conference or you know as you saw for us we now have sponsors at our conference um so these could be companies that are sponsoring the conference or maybe they're contributing to your open source project so if you think about the world kind of the community as consumers and producers and and this is uh really fits into the the model whit was talking about with kind of the four tiers if you kind of split that into kind of just two and then you have these two groups and there's always a question of well of course everybody wants to have lots of people in the community as producers right we want lots of people writing valuable blog posts on our blog right and we want everybody to be posting great answers on our forum but that's not typically how it starts right and and sometimes it doesn't even get there at all um so the the the way i encourage people to think about this is to think about in two phases and in phase one really it's your company that is the producer right so you're the one responding to posts on your forum and you're the one writing blogs or posts on your blog um you're the one speaking at the conference and uh in our first conference we did have a lot of speakers from the outside but we actually didn't have any sponsors or maybe we had a handful of maybe four or five sponsors right because it was the first one it was it was hard to convince anybody to sponsor and it was hard to get great speakers in the first one but now that it's you know our second or our third conference and you know we have 10 000 people attending i can tell you it's actually pretty easy to attract speakers to the conference because you know who doesn't want to get the word out to 10 000 people and who doesn't want to sponsor an event like that with 10 000 attendees um and so it always starts with yourself kind of being the sole producer and that's something that you should embrace and actually be okay with and and you know look at how do you fund that how do you assign people to to do that and but if you do it right then over time a lot of these things not all of them um can actually start being kind of a fly wheel they can start uh you know getting to a point where the consumers actually start becoming producers as well obviously a small portion of them but that's that's really all you need and so just think about these things in two phases and that makes it a lot easier and you don't get frustrated why aren't other people responding on on my forum all right so that's that's what i had hopefully that was uh that was helpful and i'll hand it back here to uh to whit amazing thank you tomorrow so so cool and just really very actionable um matt i'm going to introduce mac um ceo of com store is going to talk more about um measurement um and connecting some of these community actions and and how do you get buy-in in your business and how do you how do you measure yourself max take it away awesome let me share my screen here to get my my slides up here we go quick quick introduction on on where my i guess expertise and thoughts here are are coming from uh as as mentioned i'm the founder and ceo of comsore we're building tools for community companies uh like the community os and mitsi we just raised uh our an a round back in january and uh put our product out in market the same same month um on top of that we also run a community called the community club which has actually quickly become the one of the largest communities for community professionals in the world so that's where our our actual community building we're very much uh you know getting higher on supply if you will building a community rather than just building a product for the community space uh whoops there we go so uh there's a let's start with some sort of uh some groundwork here that might overlap a little bit with what has already been been mentioned but it's all it's all part of the presentation that when you're not investing in community you have this self-fulfilling prophecy where there's a lack of understanding which leads to a lack of ability to measure community which leads to a back a lack of ability of proving impact of community which in turn leads to the lack of investment and community buildings a little bit of taking out leap of faith because unlike other functions in a business like sales marketing things like that it's a lot harder to linearly understand the value of just putting a dollar in getting two dollars out it's much more of a involved organic slightly open-ended process which is where a lot of companies make the mistake of investing in community i've seen a lot of companies say they're launching community they hire a community manager they open a forum they spin up some events six months later they haven't proved the impact and they shut it all down and say see community was a failure so you have to be able to like understand why you're investing in it and how you're investing otherwise you'll get sucked into this cycle uh the old way uh community used to be historically this thing that bounced around at companies people weren't quite sure if it was product or sales or success or marketing where should community live was it one was it the other if you i mean even today you go and ask community managers who have you reported to historically you will hear pretty much every department that is is possible at a company but now we're finally seeing this evolution where community is actually becoming more than just a thing that sits next to product and sales and success and marketing and actually becoming this like core that sits between all these things and actually acts as like a thread through an entire community like business and community itself is its own flywheel and has to exist for the sake of community itself you can't build community to drive sales or to drive marketing or to reduce support costs community has to exist for a broader purpose and those benefits will spin out of that in a more uh organic way so before i jump into kind of the the second half of my presentation here talk about how like we we at comsort define community from a business perspective we define it as four different layers of community obviously a little bit of overlap with with previous things but we think about it more from a holistic business perspective than just a community perspective with market uh external or audience customer or member and internal and i'll go a bit deeper into each of those real quick so internal community is is your company that's the core of your community right and there's more and more we've seen individuals within companies actually impact community outside of the business the application of community-led principles internally probably the least interesting one for those of you here customer community or member community this is what's traditionally considered community in a lot of companies these are people that are gathering on your forums on your slack attending your events they're kind of part of your spaces that you are creating this is what's traditionally owned by a community team and i use figma here on the right as an example for like what these different levels might look like for a company configmed their slack their events their local user groups their ambassador programs things like that one layer up you have your external or your audience community this is more of like the social media the marketing the content marketing things like that where they might not be gathering on spaces and that line between audience and community starts to starts to get blurred but that's that's one one layer up for figment their twitter their instagram their education programs their email newsletter etc and then you have market community that's basically the entire market in which your business exists so for figma people talking about figma on reddit our web design or on design twitter or on dribble those are all part of figma's community even if they're not necessarily engaging with figma directly or on channels that figma owns or controls and yeah so communities about authentic relationships and when it comes to data and kpis it can help you understand a community but data won't build a community for you it can be a bridge though between community and other functions to help you prove the value of community for the entire organization it was in the poll i know a lot of you have mentioned that the main kpi you're using for measuring your community is size of community and a little call here that from our perspective that's a bit of the the cardinal sin of community data i know folks that have two three 400 person communities that can justify that it's driving millions of dollars of value of business for their company and others that have hundreds of thousands of members in their community and they can't put a number on the impact that's actually having for their business so it's there's also like negative network effects as communities get too big so size of committee isn't always the right way to measure the the success and the outcome of community so going back to this little flywheel we've put together here where we have community at the core and it's spinning off benefits for all these pieces i'm going to go a bit deeper into the different ways you can think about community overlapping with each of these different functions well actually before i do that i forgot the order of my own slides um using comparative metrics not point in time to tell a story is how you're going to prove the value to the rest of the business if you're a community manager you're working on community and you have 5 000 people in a forum and you go to your head of marketing or your head of sales or your ceo and you're like we get 5 000 numbers their reaction very likely is going to be okay as the head of sales why do i care about that so you have to find a way to like convert the language of community into language that the rest of the company will understand and tell a comparative story whether that's you know account value goes up when they join the community churn rate goes down nps goes up number of support tickets goes down right depending on the community some of these metrics will be applicable to you some of them will not and and finding those ways to convert that story into something the rest of the company will understand and care about will be the best way to prove the the impact of uh of community and i don't know where my image is there oh there we go just took a second to load there so as far as community and product uh here's a great quote from uh one of the co-founders of linear uh without a continuous feedback channel like the slack community we'd probably build the wrong things so community can be a great way especially early on to to understand and get feedback from super users early adopters things like that and it can you know for product feedback user research for open source development there's huge amounts of implications there that very often i know the primary purpose of this presentation is talking about you know sales and and marketing and and growth but product feedback is actually a huge thing you'll get from bringing people together to intentionally talk about your product and actually enabling to talk to each other about your product will unlock ideas and feedback that previously were not accessible uh community-led sales obviously a big one here it's uh it's no longer about driving sales you're not building the community for the sake of sales you're building a relationship as whitney mentioned quite quite strongly around you're building a relationship and the sale will kind of happen organically for that as an example uh at com store 90 of our customers to date have come in through our community where they actually joined our community built a relationship there and then organically came in for uh for the product it's very similar to product growth sign up for the free trial try the product out then upgrade it's just about putting like human relationship into that into that process so it can drive community qualified leads pre-sales relationships and i mean a whole host of other other benefits community qualified leads i think whitney mentioned this briefly but the way we look at a com soar is taking more traditional lead scoring and then combining that with engagement scoring so looking at not just are they potentially a customer through you know industry role size things like that but how are they engaging with you and at what threshold have they been warmed enough by the community that they could actually become a customer if you uh i don't know if anyone has ever experienced this but i know i have in the past where you join a community for a company and the first thing you get is like the linkedin request from a salesperson like hey i saw you join your slack you want to buy your product like destroys the community pretty much instantly so they do of community qualified leads is let the community warm the leads for you it's kind of similar to like it's almost like an evolution of content marketing right but old sales will be like hey you want to buy a product no okay i'll come back in three months hey do you want to buy a product now okay no i'll come back in three months you try again content marketing was like okay let's give them some value maybe they'll buy our product okay give them some more value maybe they'll buy our product whereas community led sales is about continually building that value so for us for example a console when we try to sell to someone if they're not ready to buy right now we don't say okay reach out to you in six months we invite them to our community and very very often within three to six months they'll organically reach back out on their own because they've now spent three to six months building a relationship with us even though they weren't ready to buy originally yeah don't let your sdrs use your community list as an outreach list that will that will destroy once again community cannot exist for the sake of sales it has to exist for the sake of the community there has to be a bigger why besides your product uh for support and success you know community can be the first line of defense for your support teams ticket deflection uh customer education customer satisfaction using the community to both uh reduce tickets like we're working with a customer right now we were able to show them that their average uh their average customer sent three support tickets per quarter but when they joined their community on average that dropped to one you now start to put an actual dollar value to support reduction that community is driving for you and i'm trying to wrap up here see if we can get a few moments of q a in here community and marketing this is one of the ones that's a little harder to put an actual number on or a kpi but building a community in your space helps with brand building thought leadership content development you'll get content ideas from the community you'll be able to leverage the community create content with you uh and it also imagine like you know for us we own community club it's like one of the best communities for communities in the world right now so people start to associate community club and comsource brand and just community as a as a broader as a broader uh brand in the community space and it's a good transition to building a broader a broader community so the old way was the idea of a community of support you would buy the product first then you join the community and usually it's only appealing to customers limited conversation it's usually used for like product support issues bug reporting things like that whereas a community of interest broadens the scope and actually allows the community to become the first touch point for your customers so like for comms or people don't buy commslore and then join the community club they join the community club and then buy com soar it flips the script and it allows you to appeal to a broader market there are thousands of members in our community that will never be uh comps or customers they're just not a good fit for what we're building but they provide value to the rest of the community members who could and be and are promised our customers it allows us to create thought leadership in the space it can still contain that community of support within it and allows us to actually give the community its own voice it's no longer the consort community it's its own brand its own voice its own identity and i'll end here is that community is the cross-functional core for your company it's not a thing you bolt on it's something that has to be an entire mindset to how you build your company how you build sales how you build marketing it's it's a thread through every department at your company oh my lord i'm just like so inspired listening to both of you it's just it's insane yeah i spent a lot of time with the portfolio we're talking about some of these things so it's just so great to hear from both of you uh about this so thank you so much for uh your presentations and your insights um super super valuable um we have one question in the chat that i want to make sure we cover i'll set a couple other questions because people have some questions i know it's got like two minutes um so tomer uh how do you measure and track adoption of open source i think you had a slide specifically on how you were doing that but just wanted to kind of tie that out off just make sure that we uh answered that you know there's there's there's not always an easy way but um obviously if the open source thing is something that you control like in the case of you know for us project nessie that is something that we control it's our own github kind of repo and we can see usage uh kind of metrics on that um for other projects if it's owned by like uh if it's like an apache project apache software foundation then um you know you can get kind of logs in our case because we also package it as a python build that you can get um from the pi pi um repository there's there's metrics for for downloads there that you can actually download and get all that data so it depends on exactly the type of open source project and where it's hosted um how you would actually get those metrics and we also have a question just rolled in uh what are the best tools to track influence um i've got a couple of opinions here max love to hear uh your your feedback as well um sometimes uh you just go out and you collect the data manually you look at people who are you know used to twitter you look uh within the space and you kind of you kind of you you pull it all together into a spreadsheet that's just one thing you can do to kind of brute force it and understand exactly who's influential within the uh target service that you're doing uh another one is obviously there's no a free tool called orbit which uh we've seen some companies use uh max is something that comfort supports or do you have some other opinions as well yeah something we support i think there's a lot of social listening tools if you're specifically trying to track it on social channels that do it as well so i think it depends on what you're defining influence as and where specifically you're trying to track it there's kind of five or six different categories of influence that would change my answer there depending yeah 100 uh we're at time so thank you everyone um for joining us today again awesome conversation a lot of great insights here um and uh we're excited that the nice thing about the community uh the community marketing and clg their everything's changing rapidly right there's new players there's new tools um it's very it's still very early days i feel for this motion um and i think mac really hit it home appropriately where it really has to be a strategic initiative that your your company's bought into can't just be a bolt-on right so uh i'm looking forward to seeing how everyone applies some of this and go out there and start building some communities and driving some business awesome thanks for having me.
