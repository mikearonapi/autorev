- If you're driving growth
for your SaaS business, it can be really easy and tempting to just jump into go-to-market execution. Execution is you running
a thousand cold emails or running a bunch of ads or
running a bunch of blog posts and hiring an SEO consultant. All of those things can be
really easy to just jump into 'cause it feels good, it's
a bunch of activities. But here's the thing though. You can send a thousand emails and you may still hear crickets.

You can spend a thousand dollars on ads and still get nothing back. This is where go-to-market
strategy comes into play. Here's the question though. What exactly goes into
a go-to-market strategy? What do you actually need to do so you're not wasting a bunch
of time on froufrou stuff and you actually get to the brass tacks of creating a go-to-market strategy so that when you send
those thousand emails, they're actually effective? In this episode, I'm gonna break down the five key components to revamping your go-to-market strategy so that you can accelerate your path to that next stage of growth. Intro.

(lively music) What's up, everybody?

part of this community, if you're part of my SaaS
go-to-market coaching programs, my people. Ooh, that hurt. Welcome back. It's really awesome to see you over here.

So I was on a call with the founder once and they were walking me through what they were doing
for their go-to-market. They had sent a thousand cold emails, they had hired an agency
to run a bunch of ads, and yet there was no pipeline
actually being generated. In fact, the only revenue they actually generated successfully was through their own network, through actual referrals
that were coming through from just talking to
people they already knew, but they were tapping out of that. And we dug into exactly
what they were doing. And very quickly it was pretty clear that they were making the same
mistake that baby TK made.

They were jumping to execution instead of actually
thinking about strategy. Now, in this episode, I'm gonna walk you through the five critical components that you absolutely need to know on how to transform your
go-to-market strategy. And I've only included the
things that actually matter and cut out the things that
are just a waste of time. So if you're excited to dig
into principle number one, go ahead and smash that Like button for the YouTube algorithm that just loves it when you do that, and let's dig right into it. So first thing to understand
is what is the difference between strategy versus execution.

I kind of alluded to this already, but it's important to really define it. Execution is the stuff that you do. It's what you are doing to
actually generate pipeline. Now, strategy is how
you go about doing it. Now, when I put it in a thing like this, it makes perfect sense that
you should do strategy.

Why do we not do it? Because so many people go
around just talking strategy and it seems like a waste of time. There are parts of it
that actually matter. How you go about running
your go-to-market plays makes a difference on how
effective it's going to be, regardless of how hard you work at it. So that's principle number one. What you're really doing when you're defining your
go-to-market strategy, how do you filter through
what matters and what doesn't, you're focusing on how are we gonna go about sending those code emails or running those ads or
running those blog posts or anything else that you are doing.

Principle number two, as part of go-to-market
strategy, is to do the math. This is a piece of math
that most people don't do. There are natural laws of averages. What that means is if you reach out and generate 50 ICP leads, ICP
meaning your ideal customers, if you're doing 50 leads that
are completely new random, then it'll be 0% conversion rate. But let's just say you really target your targeted customers, people that are perfect
for your SaaS product.

Well, out of those 50, no matter how great your product is, only five of them will turn into real opportunities and trials. That's the law of averages,
that's just how it works. Why isn't it 100%? Well, they might be busy, it
might not be the right time, they didn't get you email,
any number of those things. Out of those five trials or opportunities, one will become a customer. This rough conversion rate where only 10% of the
people you're engaging with will turn into real
opportunities at that time and only 20% of those people
will turn into real customer is pretty much average
when it comes to SaaS.

Can it be better? Absolutely. But that's basically your average. And if you're not doing this math, you're not really realizing exactly how much activity
you need to drive as part of your
go-to-market to get results. And you might stop at
the 49th lead and say, "This is not working, let's
just stop, let's give up." Instead, if you do the math as part of your go-to-market
strategy, then you'll know, "Well, we need to generate at least 50 ideal customer profile leads in order to really know if
this is working or not." So that's principle number two. Principle number three is to actually flesh
out what your target is.

So this happens all the time when you hire an agency that
doesn't know any better. They'll say, "Cool, we'll
spend all your money." They make a percentage of
every ad dollar you spend. So they don't really care that much. Even if they only last three months, that's still money in
their bank no matter what. It's kind of like how Wall Street works.

When you are fleshing out
your go-to-market strategy that allows you to make some decisions that can hold any marketing contractor, any agency truly accountable, you should go to them and say, "Hey, this is the entire world. This is our total addressable market. This is the group of customers
that are most likely to buy." Now, that is an example of
an ideal customer profile. When I work with founders on developing their
ideal customer profile, there are 29 different points that go into developing
an ideal customer profile. That's why it's so effective
when you run the execution.

What's really important
for you to flesh out right this moment is to figure out what your true, ideal
customer profile looks like. Where are you gonna be targeting your go-to-market activities? And most importantly, how are you going to
differentiate in the market? Because here's the thing. I'm sure your SaaS product is very unique, but when you approach a random stranger, even in your ideal customer profile, they probably can think of one or two other software companies that have already approached
them or they've tried or they have an Excel spreadsheet that's already doing the job pretty well. And so you have to show up
in a very differentiated way, and you have to be able to compete against the other players
that are in the market, which is why it's super important when you're defining your
ideal customer profile, one of the 29 points we talk about is how do you actually differentiate. Where can you differentiate? Where are you actually differentiated? And let's focus on that group, and then you can expand over time.

And that's the power of
principle number three to actually flesh out your targeting. Now, lemme just pause here for a second. I have two more right here. But before I go into principle number four and principle number five, are you starting to see the power in this? These are not complicated things. They're not totally
crazy, waste of timers.

These are basic brass tacks of strategy you need to just lay out so that you're going to be successful in any go-to-market activity
that you're gonna run. If you just do these three basics, you start to think about how
are we gonna approach this, what is our math, and
what is our targeting, if you just start on these three things and even don't do number
four and number five, can you see the power of
what you're gonna be doing in terms of your actual activities or whoever you hire to do the job for you? If you start to see the power in this, can I just get a yes
in the comments below? That way I know you're with me. Also smash out Like button for the YouTube algorithm
if you're getting value. Just loves it when you
do that and so do we. We put a lot of love into these videos.

Also, if you're in this
stage where you're like, "Oh my God, I gotta figure out how to generate more pipeline, I gotta flesh out my
go-to-market strategy, I need to actually do
this in a proper way," then this is why I run my SaaS
go-to-market coaching program where you and I work together to actually build your
go-to-market strategy and drive the execution. You don't have to go anywhere right now. I'll tell you more about it
at the end of this episode. I'll link to it below. Let's go to principle number four 'cause this one's super important, one of my favorites, and
brings it all together.

Principle number four is once you have, okay, we're gonna think
about the strategy, this is our math, this is
our ideal customer profile, principle number four is to
figure out your messaging. You might say, "We already
have our messaging." It's great. Well, let's stress test it. Fill out this simple sentence. We help blank accomplish blank.

That's the result. If you can fill out this sentence without overrunning the index
card or going into font six, then you may have some solid messaging. Then I would ask you,
is it working or not? What I find very often is
because the ICP is not defined, the messaging is not great, which means that every
outbound email you're writing or every ad you're writing or the topic you're selecting
for your blog is off because you're not thinking about exactly who you're targeting and what they need to hear for you to differentiate in the market. So that's principle number four. Once you have those pieces, you can custom craft the right messaging.

And this example sentence is
just a part of your messaging. This is your value proposition. This value proposition
can go in a lot of places, including your homepage. But there's a deeper framework to follow to really develop the messaging so that every cold email, every ad, every lead magnet, your homepage, your investor page deck
has a crisp message on exactly who you're targeting, why, and why they should go with you. Once you have all of these
pieces, congratulations, you have the beginnings of
a go-to-market strategy.

Then comes the execution, and this is where a lot of
people go wrong as well. What tends to happen very
often is you do TikTok today and then you do YouTube. Oh, TK's doing a YouTube channel, I should do a YouTube
channel for my SaaS business. Or you do LinkedIn or maybe
you switch to Twitter, you're all over the place. The right way to deploy
your go-to-market strategy is through principle number five, which is what I call a Broadway show.

A Broadway show is a
consistent set of sales and marketing activities that you run to achieve what I call
conversation dominance around your ideal customer profile. This is your ideal customer. They have a phone, they have social feeds, they have their inbox,
they're searching on Google. You need to make sure you're
running an orchestrated set of activities to actually
have your messaging appear around your targeted
ideal customer profile, and you need to do that
consistently every single week. That's the power of a true,
scalable go-to-market machine.

And so if you're running a bunch of random thousand
emails or some blog posts or you paid some random
agency run by an ex-pizza boy and you're like, "I don't
know why it's working," these are the five principles
that you need to follow to revamp your go-to-market strategy. Let's recap. So principle number one, know the difference between
strategy versus execution. Strategy is how you're gonna
go about generating pipeline, execution is what you're going to do. And guess what? You really, really, especially
in the early stages, can't hire someone to do it.

It has to be founder led. That's what I found. Number two, do the go-to-market math. Just know that out of 50 ICP leads, five will become opportunities,
one will become a customer, and you need to keep iterating,
and every time you iterate, you may have to reset the math. That's how you get better and better.

Number three, make sure
you have clear targeting. Build out an ideal customer profile where you're gonna be differentiated. That's super important. Know who the competition
is, and then based on that, number four, build the messaging. Your value prop is just one part of it.

There are other pieces that
go into proper messaging. And then finally, run a set
of consistent set of sales and marketing activities
called a Broadway show to achieve conversation dominance around your ideal customer. That way, everywhere they go, your company, your messaging will appear. That's the power of a proper
go-to-market strategy. And now you know the
five critical components that you need to focus on
and start thinking about to transform your go-to-market strategy so you can actually drive
growth for your SaaS business.

Now, what you may not know is, TK, how actually do I
think about strategy? Like what are the steps? How do I think about
the go-to-market math? This seems pretty simple,
but there must be more to it. How do I build an ideal customer profile? How do I flesh out my messaging so it's actually differentiated
versus me making it up? And lastly, how do I take
that go-to-market strategy and actually run a Broadway show, a consistent set of sales
and marketing activities that gets my message
to my ideal customers? This is why I run my SaaS
go-to-market coaching program. Inside of this program, we
follow a three-step process to revamp your go-to-market strategy and run a Broadway show. We first out your ideal customer profile. This is the 29 points that we look through to make sure you have a
proper ideal customer profile.

Then we develop your messaging. That's what I call a manifesto. That's your core strategic narrative. That's your value prop,
that's your positioning to make sure that you're
differentiated in the market. And then you deploy the manifesto and bring it to your ideal
customers using a Broadway show.

It is an incredible program. We've shared so many success
stories on this channel on founders that have
gone through this program, grown their companies,
raised follow-on funding, or gotten to profitability. Half the founders in the
program are bootstrapped and the other half are venture backed. And I work with you directly
when you join the program. So if you wanna work together inside of the go-to-market program and actually revamp your
go-to-market strategy and implement these steps in a step-by-step way with my coaching, I encourage you to go to tkkader.com/gtm, tkkader.com/gtm.
