## 🎯 Map: Research → AutoRev Features

### **Your Tier System (Free → Collector → Tuner → Founder)**

**Relevant Videos:**
- `3ETQOVwLhJM` - Pricing Strategy Could 10x Revenue
- `vudlSZun8nk` - How to Price Membership Site 2025
- `myoitPf6e-8` - Psychology of Pricing
- `gvV-ZgXdfUM` - Freemium vs Premium Data-Backed
- `1wElP5N6QgY` - Hidden Costs Free Trials, Power Freemium
- `v-bCGaYc4jw` - Freemium vs Free Trial

**Key Learnings to Apply:**
- ✅ AutoRev has freemium (Free tier) ✓ Good for acquisition
- ⚠️ Only 2-5% convert from free → paid (expect this)
- ✅ Clear value gates between tiers (AL credits, saved events, garage)
- 🔄 Consider annual pricing (2-month discount for commitment)
- 🔄 Test "limited spots" messaging for Founder tier (scarcity psychology)

---

### **Your Internal Discord (Ops Only)**

**Note:** AutoRev's Discord is for INTERNAL OPS (you and Cory monitoring deployments, errors, signups) - NOT a user-facing community.

**Relevant Videos (For Future User Community):**
- `tPH9Pq5os7g` - 6 Methods to Monetize Discord Server
- `1ig-3Gvh5ZE` - Discord's 200M User Growth Strategies
- `5wEG2h5hfzY` - Grow SaaS Faster with Community

**Current State:**
- ✅ You have Discord webhooks for ops (deployments, AL, feedback, etc.)
- ✅ Works well for keeping founders in sync
- ❌ No user-facing Discord community currently

**Future Consideration (Post-Launch):**
- 🔄 Build user Discord if retention data warrants it
- 🔄 For now, Events = your community touchpoint
- 🔄 Evaluate need based on post-beta retention metrics

**Current ROI:** Events serve as community activation. Revisit Discord for users if churn becomes an issue.

- 🔄 Position AL as primary value prop (not just add-on)
- ⚠️ Don't make AL freemium (kills margins per video #72PBx2CtKO4)

**Quote from Research:**

## 🚫 What NOT to Do (Based on Research)

### **From "Top 10 GTM Mistakes"** (Video 7igT_vZGxsA)

❌ **Don't hire strategists** - Hire doers who hit quotas
❌ **Don't cut marketing to zero** - You're cutting your future
❌ **Don't weaponize customer success** - Someone must own "make customers happy"
❌ **Don't hire for the logo** - Hire for skills and passion
❌ **Don't expect instant ROI** - Building pipeline takes time
❌ **Don't raise prices without earning it** - Add value first
❌ **Don't step out of sales too early** - Founder = dedicated middler
❌ **Don't hire broken/bitter/fractional** - Hire people who want to play

### **From Vertical SaaS Videos**

❌ **Don't try to serve everyone** - Deep niche focus wins
❌ **Don't ignore community as GTM** - Community > paid acquisition in verticals
❌ **Don't copy horizontal SaaS playbooks** - Vertical needs different approach

### **From Pricing Videos**

❌ **Don't use freemium for AI features** - High costs, low conversion
❌ **Don't create too many tiers** - 3-4 tiers max
❌ **Don't make free tier too good** - Must have clear upgrade triggers
