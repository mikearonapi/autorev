        "summary": "* the passenger airbag light came on July 2025. I was not in a accident the light just came on.  * 7/29/2025 I took my car in for service at Infinity of Las Vegas (the only Infinity dealership in Las Vegas) I asked to check why the airbag light was on.  I was told the occupant sensor unit was abnormal. Sensor and module internally shorted out. Recommend to replace passenger front seat frame assembly (only available as a 1 piece both sensor and module internally shorted seat frame Assy). @ $ 8678.76. Because it’s a different seat from the original seat, I would have to also replace the seat belt. @ 116.87.  * It is not recommended to drive a car with the air bag light on. This car is my only source of transportation.  * on August 4, 2025 I took my car to Auto Dynamic Services and they suggested initial repair was to replace the Occupant Detection Module. The part was ordered from Nissan, when they received the part it was an updated part design which was slightly larger with more pins than the original part and could not be used on my car. They reordered the part from another Nissan retailer ensuring it matched the original part for my car.   Now it’s Aug. 27th, 2025.  Auto Dynamic received the correct replacement module. Unfortunately the part was replaced and the airbag light came on again.  They also stated the seat would have to be replaced in order for the airbag light to go off. For around the same price.   It cost me 1800.00 to find this out.  *  I do not have money to resolve this issue especially if the driver airbag errors next, I am fearful of the unknown driving around with the airbag light on. If in an accident possibly not being covered because I was driving with a know issue. Or the bags just deploying randomly.  *  On [XXX] I traded a perfect running car in, I did not receive much on the trade as the airbag light is on. I can drive safely and register the car when required  * it looks like there was a recall but the Q50 2.0 turbo was not included.

        "summary": "I’m reporting a safety issue with my 2016 Infiniti Q50.  Last Friday [XXX], my the car wouldn’t crank and there was minimal dashboard power, but the engine wouldn’t start. After receiving a jump, I had the battery replaced assuming it was the issue. However, six days later, while driving, the vehicle suddenly lost all electrical power mid-drive with no warning or dashboard alerts. The engine shut off, the brake pedal became stiff, and I was unable to use any power-operated functions, such as rolling down the windows (98 degree day in Texas) or opening the trunk, which contained my emergency tools.  A police officer had to assist and the vehicle was towed. Upon inspection, the issue was traced to corroded battery terminal cables, which were blocking the signal from the new battery and causing the full shutdown.  This is a serious safety concern as complete power failure while driving, with no warning, and no manual trunk release for emergencies, could place drivers at significant risk. I’m submitting this for review and potential recall consideration. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

I bought the vehicle new and drove it over the last 5 years as a back-up vehicle to a Chevy Cruze (w/greater than 180K miles on it and no faulty parts). I did not purchase the extended warranty because it was supposedly a reliable vehicle, based on my prior history/ownership of a 2006 G50. I made timely payments for 5 years, performed all of the required maintenance, and took my car in for all of the Infiniti “recalls.” After the ability to turn failed, I took the vehicle to Bommarito Infiniti for a diagnostic and routine oil change. The steering diagnostic found 3 leaks on the steering rack and pinion., (no oil was visible on the ground). I did not have any warning lights for low steering fluid or service required indicators, but the dealership stated the power steering fluid was low. I contacted Infiniti Consumer Affairs department for review of the faulty part, considering that I had less than 23k miles on the vehicle. Stewart at Infiniti Consumer Affairs stated that the claim for repair assistance was denied due to the vehicle being out of warranty and the \"lack of service history\" with Bommarito Infiniti. When I questioned him about defining/explaining what he meant by the lack of history, he could not explain his statement. He placed me on hold, and then returned only to reiterate his previous statement. I then informed him and verified with the dealership that I did not deny any required repair or service that was recommended/required. The dealership also stated that the rack and pinion that was installed on my Q50 had to be a faulty part because this is the 1st time that a 2016 Q50 with less than 36k miles has ever needed this part replaced.

      "essence": "A genuine sleeper that combines Mercedes-rivaling luxury with legitimate 400hp performance from its twin-turbo V6. The Q50 Red Sport punches well above its price point, delivering exotic car acceleration in a practical four-door package.",
      "heritage": "Born from Infiniti's G37 lineage and the legendary VQ engine family, the Q50 Red Sport represents the brand's most serious attempt at challenging BMW's 340i and Mercedes C43 AMG with homegrown Japanese engineering.",
      "design_philosophy": "Infiniti aimed to create a sophisticated sport sedan that didn't scream for attention, blending muscular proportions with elegant Japanese restraint while hiding serious performance potential beneath refined bodywork.",
      "motorsport_history": "While not directly race-bred, the Q50 Red Sport shares DNA with Infiniti's Formula One involvement and draws from decades of VQ engine development in NISMO performance applications.",
      "engine_character": "The VR30DDTT is a masterpiece of modern forced induction - smooth and refined at idle, but transforms into a relentless powerhouse under boost with linear delivery and surprising top-end pull that feels more naturally aspirated than most turbos.",
      "transmission_feel": "The 7-speed automatic is surprisingly sharp for a luxury-focused gearbox, with quick downshifts and reasonably crisp upshifts, though it lacks the snap of dedicated performance transmissions from German rivals.",
      "chassis_dynamics": "Balanced and composed with adaptive dampers that genuinely transform the car's character, offering comfortable cruising and surprisingly sharp handling when pushed, though ultimate limits favor comfort over pure aggression.",
      "steering_feel": "Direct-Adaptive Steering provides excellent precision and weighting, though purists may miss the mechanical connection of traditional systems - the feedback is there but feels slightly synthesized.",
      "brake_confidence": "Strong and consistent with good pedal feel, the Akebono-sourced brakes provide reliable stopping power for spirited driving, though extended track use may expose thermal limitations.",
      "sound_signature": "A sophisticated growl that's more refined than aggressive - the twin-turbo V6 produces a cultured rumble with subtle turbo whistle, enhanced by active exhaust tuning that adds drama without being obnoxious.",
      "ideal_owner": "Performance enthusiasts who want German sport sedan capability without the maintenance costs, or luxury buyers seeking more excitement than a typical premium sedan offers.",
      "not_ideal_for": "Badge-conscious buyers seeking ultimate prestige, track day addicts wanting maximum performance focus, or those preferring naturally aspirated engine character.",
      "buyers_summary": "The Q50 Red Sport 400 represents exceptional performance value, offering legitimate 400hp thrills with luxury refinement at a price that undercuts German rivals. Look for 2018+ models with updated infotainment and consider the adaptive suspension package essential.",
