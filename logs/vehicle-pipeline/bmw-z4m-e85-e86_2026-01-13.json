This has started to happen after hot weather had started few months back. I have tried to reproduce this issue several times, but it happens randomly and Not all the time. I don't drive the car much. But this is definitely a serious issue, I checked the BMW community and a lot of people are facing this issue. Not Sure how many have filed a complaint here. But this definitely should be addressed by BMW as this is not just one person facing this issue, there are hundreds and thousands of them. Level of severity is high, as someone who might have not faced this issue yet might suddenly face it on the highway could result in an extremely fatal accident. Havent reported to BMW yet, But found this issue is being faced by alot of people I thought to file my complaint here. I will soon get it repaired or replaced. There were no Warning lamps or messages prior to this. It started happening in September 2021.",

ONE SOURCE WHO IS AN ASE-CERTIFIED MASTER TECHNICIAN SAYS THAT THE \"BMW Z4 STICKY STEERING IS RELATED TO A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, THAT HAS BEEN RECTIFIED AS OF 2007 AND UP. THERE IS A BEARING LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STEERING COLUMN THAT IS NOT SEALED. WITH TIME AND WHEN HOT, THE LUBRICANT GETS DRY AND GUMS UP. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THERE IS NOT A RACE FOR THE BEARING TO RIDE IN ' THE INNER RACE IS ACTUALLY THE STEERING SHAFT ITSELF, WHICH IS A POOR DESIGN\".     MY VEHICLE WAS BUILT IN 2006 AND HAS ONLY 54,000 MILES ON IT.  BMW APPARENTLY WAS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND CORRECTED IT THE FOLLOWING MODEL YEAR. THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM, WHICH COULD GET WORSE OVER TIME.  BMW SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT.",

IT APPEARS TO BE LINKED TO SIMILARLY REPORTED BMW MODELS RECALLS INVOLVING THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AIR BAG SENSOR MAT FAILURES, WHICH REQUIRES SEAT AIR BAG SENSOR MAT REPLACEMENT. THE PROBLEM IS IT IS NOT CLEAR IF CURRENT AIR BAG SENSOR MAT RECALLS INCLUDE AND COVER THE BMW 2006 Z4 PASSENGER AIR BAG SEAT SENSOR MAT REPLACEMENT. THE CAR WAS PURCHASED FROM  BMW DEALER AS A PRE-OWNED CERTIFIED CAR UNDER FULL WARRANTY. THE DEALER WOULD NOT ADDRESS REPAIRS UNDER THE CURRENT RECALLS.NEED YOUR HELP, THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY Z4 ON THE ROAD AND THE NUMBER OF OWNER REPORTED FAILURES IS LIKELY TO BE A SMALL NUMBER BUT THIS DOES NOT DIMINISH THE FACT THAT THE SEAT SENSOR MAT IN A Z4 ARE THE SAME EQUIPMENT BEING RECALLED FOR OTHER BMW MODELS. PLEASE EXTEND THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AIR BAG SENSOR MAT RECALL TO INCLUDE THE 2006 Z4 MODELS.

DURING THE TEST DRIVE I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WAS UNUSUALLY STIFF AND AT HIGHER SPEEDS THE CAR WAS SOMEWHAT HARD TO KEEP IN A STRAIGHT LINE. I DISMISSED THE ISSUE AS A POSSIBLE ALIGNMENT OR WORN OUT TIRE ISSUE. ON THE 120 MILE DRIVE HOME TO RALEIGH, NC THE STEERING BECAME MORE AND MORE ERRATIC, PUSHING THE CAR HALF WAY TO THE OTHER LANE. I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WAS GETTING REALLY STICKY AND JERKY THE LONGER I DROVE. WHEN TRYING TO SLIGHTLY CORRECT THE TRAJECTORY OF THE CAR TO ANY SIDE, THE STEERING WOULD NOT REACT TO LIGHT TORQUE ON THE STEERING WHEEL AS IT WOULD WITH ANY OTHER CAR I'VE DRIVEN BEFORE. WHEN APPLYING MORE FORCE THE STEERING WOULD SUDDENLY JUMP A DEGREE OR MORE, CAUSING THE CAR TO OVERSTEER AND MAKING FOR SOME RALLY SCARY AND ERRATIC MANEUVERS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. WHEN TRYING TO CORRECT THIS UNEXPECTED JUMP, THE CAR WOULD DO THE SAME THING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION, CAUSING ME TO SWERVE RIGHT AND LEFT. LATER, WHEN COMING OUT OF A LONG RIGHT TURN ON A NARROW TWO LANE ROAD, THE STEERING WAS STUCK IN THE RIGHT TURN POSITION AND SUDDENLY POPPED INTO A LEFT TURNING POSITION, ALMOST CAUSING A COLLISION WITH AN ONCOMING SEMI TRUCK. SINCE THE BEHAVIOR IS SO UNPREDICTABLE AND HARD TO CONTROL, I CONSIDER THIS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY.

      "essence": "The Z4 M captures BMW M's golden era philosophy: naturally aspirated power, precise handling, and raw driver engagement without electronic interference. It's the last of its kind - a purist's M car that prioritizes feel over figures.",
      "heritage": "Born from BMW's Z4 roadster platform, the M variant arrived in 2006 as a spiritual successor to the iconic M Roadster, inheriting the legendary S54 engine from the E46 M3 and representing the final chapter of BMW's naturally aspirated M division era.",
      "design_philosophy": "Aggressive functionality defines the Z4 M's aesthetic - flared fenders house wider tracks, quad exhausts announce serious intent, and the distinctive 'flame surfacing' design language creates purposeful muscularity that hints at the S54's potential beneath.",
      "motorsport_history": "While not a direct racing derivative, the Z4 M shares DNA with BMW's motorsport programs through its S54 engine, which powered numerous racing applications and represents the pinnacle of BMW's naturally aspirated performance engine development.",
      "engine_character": "The S54 is an absolute jewel - linear power delivery builds to an intoxicating 8,000 RPM crescendo, with individual throttle bodies providing instantaneous response and a mechanical precision that modern turbo engines simply cannot match.",
      "transmission_feel": "The 6-speed manual gearbox offers satisfying mechanical precision with defined gates and appropriate weighting, though it lacks the razor-sharp action of contemporary Porsche units - it's workmanlike rather than sublime.",
      "chassis_dynamics": "The chassis strikes a brilliant balance between compliance and control, with expertly tuned suspension that remains composed through aggressive cornering while still providing reasonable comfort for daily driving duties.",
      "steering_feel": "Pure hydraulic steering delivers genuine feedback and proper weight progression, allowing precise placement and communicating road surface changes with the kind of clarity that modern electric systems struggle to replicate.",
      "brake_confidence": "Powerful and progressive braking with excellent pedal feel and strong initial bite, though the system can fade under extreme track use - more than adequate for spirited road driving and occasional track days.",
      "sound_signature": "The S54's naturally aspirated wail builds from a purposeful growl to a spine-tingling shriek at redline, accompanied by the distinctive whir of individual throttle bodies and a soundtrack that defines the golden age of M cars.",
      "ideal_owner": "Weekend warriors who prioritize driving purity over luxury, appreciate naturally aspirated engines, and want an increasingly rare analog driving experience with genuine M division pedigree and collectible potential.",
      "not_ideal_for": "Daily commuters seeking refinement, those who prioritize outright speed over character, or drivers who prefer modern conveniences and electronic assistance over raw mechanical engagement.",
