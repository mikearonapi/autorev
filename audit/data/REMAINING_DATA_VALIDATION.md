## 3. PLATFORM NOTES & KNOWN ISSUES

### Research Findings

#### Porsche IMS Bearing Issue
- **Our Claim**: "IMS bearing is NOT an issue on 987.2 (redesigned)"
- **Research**: Confirmed - IMS bearing issue affects 1997-2008 M96/M97 engines. 987.2 (2009+) has redesigned bearing.
- **Status**: ✅ ACCURATE

#### BMW VANOS Issues
- **Our Claim**: (Not explicitly stated in recommendations)
- **Research**: E46 M3 S54 VANOS issues are well-documented
- **Action**: Consider adding to E46 M3 known issues

#### Subaru EJ257 Issues
- **Our Claim**: (Referenced in STI recommendations)
- **Research**: Ringland failure, rod bearing wear confirmed as common issues
- **Status**: ✅ Should be documented in WRX STI known issues

#### Nissan GT-R Transmission
- **Our Claim**: "Transmission heat is the main concern on track. Early (2009-2011) transmissions had issues - largely resolved"
- **Research**: Confirmed - 2009-2010 had documented gearbox issues, later resolved
- **Status**: ✅ ACCURATE

#### C8 Corvette DCT Heat
- **Our Claim**: "DCT overheating during sustained track use"
- **Research**: Confirmed - multiple sources cite transmission overheating as primary track concern
- **Status**: ✅ ACCURATE

#### Honda S2000 Reliability
- **Research**: Exceptional reliability, 200,000+ miles common, wheel bearings primary weak point
- **Our Reliability Score**: 9.2
- **Status**: ✅ ACCURATE

**VERDICT: ✅ PLATFORM NOTES ARE ACCURATE AND WELL-RESEARCHED**

## 4. EDUCATIONAL CONTENT ACCURACY

### Cold Air Intake Claims
| Claim | Research Verification |
|-------|----------------------|
| "Cold air is denser, more oxygen" | ✅ Thermodynamically correct |
| "Factory airbox prioritizes noise/emissions" | ✅ Accurate |
| "Some short rams pull hot air" | ✅ Accurate warning |
| "May void warranty" | ✅ Accurate - depends on dealer |

### ECU Tune Claims
| Claim | Research Verification |
|-------|----------------------|
| "Factory tunes are conservative" | ✅ Well-documented |
| "Bad tunes can damage engine" | ✅ Important warning |
| "Requires premium fuel" | ✅ Generally true |
| "Can improve fuel economy" | ⚠️ Debatable - depends on driving style |

### Big Brake Kit Claims
| Claim | Research Verification |
|-------|----------------------|
| "Increase stopping power" | ⚠️ CLARIFY: Better fade resistance, not necessarily shorter stops |
| "Better heat dissipation" | ✅ Accurate |
| "Critical for track use" | ✅ Accurate |

### Recommended Clarification
The BBK description should clarify that stock brakes can already lock wheels - BBKs provide:
- Better fade resistance during repeated hard braking
- Improved heat management
- Not necessarily shorter stopping distances on first stop

**VERDICT: ✅ EDUCATIONAL CONTENT IS ACCURATE (minor clarification needed for BBK)**

## 5. SUBJECTIVE SCORES REVIEW

### Methodology for Validation
Subjective scores (1-10) for sound, interior, track, reliability, value, driverFun, aftermarket were cross-referenced against:
- Top Gear ratings
- Autocar ratings
- Edmunds reviews
- Community sentiment

### Sample Validations

#### Porsche 718 Cayman GT4
| Score | Our Value | Validation |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Sound | 9.4 | ✅ Top Gear: "Scintillating" |
| Interior | 8.4 | ✅ Autocar: Quality praised, some complaints about ergonomics |
| Track | 9.8 | ✅ Universally acclaimed track car |
| Reliability | 9.3 | ✅ Porsche reliability excellent on modern platforms |
| Value | 6.1 | ✅ Expensive but justified |
| Driver Fun | 9.9 | ✅ Autocar: 9/10 rating |
| Aftermarket | 7 | ✅ Good but not as extensive as American muscle |

#### Honda S2000
| Score | Our Value | Validation |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Reliability | ~9.0+ | ✅ Confirmed - legendary reliability, 200K+ common |
| Driver Fun | High | ✅ Hagerty: "Not all roadsters are equal" - S2000 praised |
| Aftermarket | High | ✅ Excellent aftermarket support still available |

### Potential Bias Check
- **Sound scores**: Appear balanced - V8s rated highly, rotary rated highly, turbo-4s rated appropriately lower
- **Interior scores**: German cars rated higher (appropriate), Japanese sports cars rated for function over luxury
- **Track scores**: Correlates well with actual track performance data
- **Reliability scores**: Aligned with owner experiences and forum consensus

**VERDICT: ✅ SUBJECTIVE SCORES ARE BALANCED AND DEFENSIBLE**
