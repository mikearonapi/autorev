Subject: Your SuperNatural Motorsports Website - How Everything Works

Hey!

I put together a complete breakdown of your website so you understand 
exactly what you have and how it all works. I know it's a lot, so I've 
organized this into digestible sections. Read what interests you, skip 
what doesn't.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE 30-SECOND SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your website is a sports car matchmaking tool. People tell it what they 
care about (sound, reliability, track performance, etc.), and it 
recommends the best cars for them from a database of 35 vehicles priced 
$25K-$100K.

There are TWO main tools:
• CAR FINDER - "Help me find the right car"
• PERFORMANCE HUB - "Show me what my car could become with upgrades"

Both are unbiased (no affiliate links, no dealerships paying for placement).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR 7 PAGES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. HOME (/)
   Front door - explains what you do, shows all 35 cars in a carousel

2. CAR FINDER (/car-finder)
   The main recommendation tool - users set priorities, get matched cars

3. PERFORMANCE HUB (/performance)
   Upgrade visualizer - like Gran Turismo, shows what upgrades would do

4. INDIVIDUAL CAR PAGES (/cars/[car-name])
   35 pages, one for each car - specs, scores, pros/cons, images

5. SERVICES (/services)
   Your hands-on work - suspension, brakes, power, track prep, etc.

6. CONTACT (/contact)
   Contact form - captures leads, stores them in your database

7. UPGRADES (/upgrades)
   Redirects to Performance HUB (legacy URL)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE TECH (SIMPLE VERSION)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEBSITE BUILDER: Next.js (what Netflix uses)
→ Fast loading, good for Google SEO

DATABASE: Supabase (fancy online spreadsheet)
→ Stores all car data, upgrades, and leads

HOSTING: Vercel (cloud servers)
→ Site stays up, loads fast worldwide

IMAGES: Vercel Blob (cloud image storage)
→ Car images load quickly

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DATABASE: WHAT'S STORED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TABLE 1: CARS (35 vehicles)
Each car has 60+ fields including:
- Basic: Name, year, price range, tier, category
- Specs: HP, torque, 0-60, braking, lateral G, weight
- Advisory Scores: 7 categories (Sound, Interior, Track, etc.)
- Performance Scores: 7 categories for upgrade visualization
- Ownership: Maintenance cost, known issues, years to avoid
- Content: Pros, cons, "best for" audience types

TABLE 2: LEADS (your potential customers)
- Email, name, interest, car they were looking at, message, timestamp

TABLE 3: UPGRADE PACKAGES
- Pre-built upgrade bundles (Street Sport, Track Pack, Time Attack, Ultimate Power)
- Each has: description, cost range, what's included, performance changes

TABLE 4: UPGRADE MODULES
- Individual parts (intake, exhaust, coilovers, brakes, etc.)
- Each has: cost, HP gain, score improvements, compatibility info

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW CAR FINDER WORKS (THE LOGIC)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is the heart of the site. Here's exactly how it matches people to cars:

STEP 1: USER SETS 7 PRIORITY SLIDERS
Each slider goes from 0x to 3x:
• Sound & Character (exhaust note, engine emotion)
• Interior & Comfort (materials, ergonomics, daily livability)
• Track Capability (lap times, cooling, brake fade resistance)
• Reliability & Ownership (maintenance costs, known issues)
• Value for Money (bang for buck, depreciation)
• Driver Engagement (steering feel, connection, throttle response)
• Aftermarket & Tuning (parts availability, tuning support)

STEP 2: THE MATH
For each car, we multiply each score by the user's priority weight:

  TOTAL = (Sound × Weight) + (Interior × Weight) + (Track × Weight) + ...

EXAMPLE:
User sets: Sound = 3x, Track = 2x, everything else = 1x
Car scores: Sound = 9, Track = 7, Interior = 6, etc.

Calculation:
  Sound:      9 × 3 = 27 points
  Track:      7 × 2 = 14 points
  Interior:   6 × 1 = 6 points
  ... and so on

The car with the highest total wins "Top Match"

STEP 3: FILTERS REMOVE NON-MATCHES
Users can set hard requirements:
• Manual transmission only
• RWD only (or AWD only)
• 2-seater only (or 4+ seats)
• Price range ($25K-50K, $40K-75K, etc.)
• Engine layout (Mid-Engine, Front-Engine, Rear-Engine)

Cars that don't meet these are hidden entirely.

STEP 4: PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on their priorities, users see 4-5 recommendation cards:
• Your Top Match (overall best based on their weights)
• Your Sound Pick (if they weighted sound highly)
• Your Track Pick (best track car for them)
• Your Value Pick (best bang for buck)
• Your Reliability Pick (most dependable)

These change dynamically based on what they care about most.

WHY THIS WORKS:
Someone who cares 3x about sound will get matched to the GT350 (sound: 10).
Someone who cares 3x about reliability will get matched to the RC F (reliability: 10).
Same database, different recommendations.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW PERFORMANCE HUB WORKS (THE LOGIC)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is like the garage screen in Gran Turismo or Forza. It shows people 
what upgrades would do to their car.

THE 7 PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES:
These are DIFFERENT from the Car Finder scores (those are advisory scores).
Performance HUB uses these for upgrade visualization:

1. Power & Acceleration (HP, torque, 0-60, quarter mile)
2. Grip & Cornering (lateral G, tire grip, chassis balance)
3. Braking (stopping distance, fade resistance, pedal feel)
4. Track Pace (overall lap time capability)
5. Drivability & Comfort (daily usability, ride quality)
6. Reliability & Heat (track endurance, thermal management)
7. Sound & Emotion (exhaust note, engagement)

HOW SCORES ARE CALCULATED:
The system calculates scores two ways:

1. EXPLICIT SCORES: Some cars have manually-curated performance scores 
   (stored as perfPowerAccel, perfGripCornering, etc.)

2. DERIVED SCORES: If no explicit scores exist, it calculates from hard data:
   • Power Score = 13 - (0-60 time × 1.5)
     → A 3.0s car = 13 - 4.5 = 8.5 ≈ 9
     → A 4.5s car = 13 - 6.75 = 6.25 ≈ 6
   
   • Grip Score = 5 + ((Lateral G - 0.9) × 22)
     → 1.0g car = 5 + (0.1 × 22) = 7.2 ≈ 7
     → 1.1g car = 5 + (0.2 × 22) = 9.4 ≈ 9
   
   • Braking Score = 10 - ((60-0 distance - 90) / 5)
     → 95 ft car = 10 - 1 = 9
     → 105 ft car = 10 - 3 = 7

THE UPGRADE SYSTEM:

Each upgrade has a "DELTA" value - how much it changes each score.

EXAMPLE: Cat-Back Exhaust
  Deltas:
    powerAccel: +0.3
    soundEmotion: +1.5
  Metric Changes:
    HP Gain: +12

EXAMPLE: Track Coilovers
  Deltas:
    gripCornering: +2.0
    trackPace: +1.5
    drivability: -1.5 (trade-off: stiffer ride)
  Metric Changes:
    Lateral G: +0.10

When a user selects upgrades, the system:
1. Takes the car's stock scores
2. Adds all the deltas from selected upgrades
3. Clamps results to 1-10 range
4. Shows the before/after comparison

THE 4 UPGRADE TIERS:

1. STREET SPORT ($3K-$8K)
   • Intake, exhaust, tune, lowering springs, brake pads
   • Small gains: +15 HP, -0.2s 0-60
   • Daily drivable, mostly warranty-safe
   • Score changes: +1 power, +0.5 grip, +1.5 sound

2. TRACK PACK ($8K-$20K)
   • Coilovers, big brakes, oil cooler, aggressive tune
   • Medium gains: +30 HP, -0.4s 0-60, -8 ft braking
   • Stiffer ride, ECU tune voids warranty
   • Score changes: +1.5 power, +2 grip, +2 braking, -1 drivability

3. TIME ATTACK ($25K-$40K)
   • Cams, ported heads, aero, slicks, roll bar
   • Big gains: +60 HP, -0.5s 0-60, -15 ft braking
   • Street compromises, all warranties voided
   • Score changes: +2 power, +3 grip, +3.5 track, -2.5 drivability

4. ULTIMATE POWER ($15K-$35K+)
   • Supercharger or turbo kit
   • Massive gains: +250 HP, -1.0s 0-60
   • Major modifications, heat management critical
   • Score changes: +4.5 power, +3 track, -1.5 drivability, -1 reliability

ENGINE-TYPE DETECTION:

The system reads each car's engine field and detects:
• NA V8 (Naturally Aspirated V8) - responds great to superchargers
• Turbo V8 - can upgrade existing turbos
• SC V8 (Supercharged V8) - pulley + tune = easy power
• NA Flat-6 (Porsche) - limited forced induction options
• Turbo I4/I6 - good tuning response

This affects what upgrades are shown and HP gain estimates.

EXAMPLE: GT350 with Whipple Supercharger
  The system knows: GT350 = NA flat-plane V8 = perfect for roots blower
  Calculated HP gain: +280 HP (526 → 800+ HP)
  This is based on real-world builds, not generic estimates.

BRAND-SPECIFIC PRICING:

Same exhaust costs different amounts depending on brand.

COST MULTIPLIERS:
• Exotic (Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, Aston Martin): 2.0x
• Premium (Porsche, BMW, Mercedes-AMG, Audi): 1.5x
• Luxury (Lexus, Jaguar, Maserati, Alfa Romeo, Lotus): 1.3x
• Mainstream (Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Nissan, Toyota): 1.0x

EXAMPLE: Big Brake Kit
• Mustang GT: $2,500 - $5,000
• Porsche Cayman: $4,500 - $9,000 (1.5x multiplier + brand override)
• Aston Martin: $5,000 - $10,000 (2.0x multiplier + brand override)

The system also has brand-specific overrides for known pricing 
(example: Porsche exhaust is always $1,800-$4,500 regardless of multiplier).

HOW LEADS ARE CAPTURED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Lead forms appear on:
• Contact page (main form)
• Footer (newsletter signup)
• Car pages ("Want to learn more?")
• Performance HUB ("Get help with your build")

Each submission captures:
• Email (required)
• Name
• Source (which page they came from)
• Interest (Car Finder, Performance HUB, Services, Pre-Purchase, Other)
