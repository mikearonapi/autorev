## Page 2: The Problem

### Enthusiasts are underserved by a fragmented, noisy market

| Pain Point | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| **Overwhelming research** | Buying a sports car requires scouring 10+ forums, YouTube channels, and classified sites |
| **No single source of truth** | Specs, reliability data, and pricing are scattered across manufacturer sites, forums, and paywalled services |
| **Generic tools** | Existing car research platforms (Edmunds, KBB, CarGurus) focus on commuter cars, not enthusiast vehicles |
| **Modification knowledge locked in forums** | Parts compatibility, dyno data, and track performance live in fragmented forum threads |
| **AI can't help yet** | ChatGPT hallucinates specs, doesn't know real-world reliability issues, and can't search your options |

**The enthusiast market has no purpose-built intelligence layer.**

## Page 5: Market Opportunity

### Sports car enthusiasts represent a passionate, high-value segment

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**

- 15M+ sports car owners in the US alone
- $50B+ spent annually on aftermarket parts and services
- Average enthusiast spends $2,500/year on their vehicle beyond insurance/fuel

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**

- 5M active enthusiasts who research, modify, or track their cars
- Currently served by fragmented forums, YouTube, and generic tools

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**

- 500K enthusiasts actively shopping or modifying in Year 1–3 target segments:
  - Porsche, BMW M, Corvette, Miata, BRZ/GR86, Mustang, Supra

**Why Now:**

1. AI finally capable of domain-specific assistance (but needs structured data)
2. YouTube has democratized expert knowledge — needs aggregation
3. Forum-era enthusiasts aging; next generation expects modern UX
4. EVs creating urgency around ICE sports car ownership

## Page 6: Business Model

### Tiered subscriptions with AI usage metering

| Tier | Price | Target User | Key Features |
|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Shoppers, browsers | Full car database, selector, safety/fuel data, ~25 AI chats/mo |
| **Collector** | $4.99/mo | Owners who want data | VIN decode, owner's reference, market values, service logs, ~75 AI chats/mo |
| **Tuner** | $9.99/mo | Modifiers, track enthusiasts | Full dyno/lap data, parts catalog, build planning, ~150 AI chats/mo |

**Revenue Streams:**

1. **Subscriptions** — Primary recurring revenue from Collector/Tuner tiers
2. **AI Overages** — Additional AL usage beyond tier limits
3. **Future: Affiliate/Parts** — Commission on verified parts purchases (not yet active)

**Unit Economics:**

- AI costs ~$0.01–0.02 per conversation (Claude Sonnet 4)
- Data maintenance is one-time per car, scales across all users
- High gross margins once data asset is built

## Page 7: Competitive Moat — The Data Asset

### Our database doesn't exist anywhere else

| Data Asset | Records | Why It Matters |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Enthusiast Scores** | 98 cars × 7 scores | Subjective scores (sound, track, reliability) — not available from any API |
| **Parts + Fitments** | 642 parts, 836 fitments | Verified compatibility for specific cars |
| **Dyno Runs** | 29 real measurements | Actual wheel HP/TQ from real cars, mods documented |
| **Lap Times** | 65 citeable runs | Track times with tire, weather, driver context |
| **Known Issues** | 154 documented | Sourced from forums, owner reports — not manufacturer data |
| **Maintenance Specs** | 98 cars × 130 columns | Oil, coolant, brake fluid, tire specs per car |
| **YouTube Intelligence** | 288 videos | AI-extracted pros/cons/summaries from trusted channels |
| **Vector Knowledge Base** | 547 chunks | Semantic search for nuanced questions |
| **Recall Data** | 241 campaigns | NHTSA recalls linked to specific cars |

**Why this is defensible:**

1. **Curation takes time** — 18+ months of manual data work
2. **AI needs structure** — Raw data doesn't help; our schema enables AL
3. **Network effects** — More users = more dyno/lap submissions = better data
4. **First-mover** — No one else building enthusiast-specific AI
