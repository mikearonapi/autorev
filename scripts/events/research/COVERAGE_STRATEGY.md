- **TX**: Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio ⚠️ (8 venues, need more)
- **FL**: Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville ❌ (1 venue - CRITICAL GAP)
- **NY**: NYC, Long Island, Buffalo ❌ (1 venue - CRITICAL GAP)
- **IL**: Chicago suburbs ⚠️ (3 venues, need more)

- ME, MN, MS, MO, MT, NV, NH, NJ, ND, OR
- RI, SC, SD, UT, VT, WV, WY

## Priority Order

### Phase 1: Fill Missing States (27 states)
Add at least 1 venue per missing state.

### Phase 2: Fix Critical Gaps (FL, NY, PA, NC, OH)
These are major population centers with inadequate coverage.

### Phase 3: Expand Tier 1 Metros
Ensure 3+ venues in all top 20 metros.

### Phase 4: Deepen Coverage
Add suburban/regional events in well-covered states.

## Target Coverage Metrics
- States covered: 50/50
- Major metros (top 20): 3+ venues each
- Secondary metros (21-50): 1-2 venues each
- Every city over 200k population: within 30 miles of a venue

## Data Quality Rules
1. All venues must be verified from web sources
2. Recurrence patterns must match actual schedules
3. Source URLs must be active websites
4. No fabricated data
